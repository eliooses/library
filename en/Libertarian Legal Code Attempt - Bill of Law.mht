</p><p>We, the founders of the free nation, in order to guard the freedom of

those who visit or settle in the free nation, do hereby affirm the following

principles, rights, and rules of procedure. We expect every person in the

free nation to abide by these fundamental laws.



</p><p>The procedural rules given here are intended as a starting point for

the development of rules for maintaining and enforcing natural rights.

These rights do not change, but the procedures for maintaining and enforcing

them can be continually improved.



</p><p>Any person offering judicial or police services in the free nation=
 shall

be free to specify more detailed rights, obligations, and procedures than

those included here, provided they are consistent with the natural law

described hereinafter.

</p><center><b>Natural Law</b></center>





<p><b>&nbsp;</b>

<br>Natural law describes the natural, voluntary order of human society.

This law is timeless, unchangeable, and universal. It takes priority over

any other law, including constitutions and contracts. It acknowledges the

right of every person to live a life that is governed by his own goals

and opinions. Natural law serves to prevent and resolve conflicts between

people pursuing contradictory goals. It stipulates that every person shall

be free to dispose of his rightfully acquired property and shall refrain

from disposing of the property of others without their permission. It permi=
ts

all activities that do not violate someone else&#x27;s person or property.



</p><p>As a matter of principle, a society based on natural law should be=
 maintained

by means consistent with that law. These means will then generate&#8212;und=
er

the disciplines of profit and loss, supply and demand, and peaceful competi=
tion

in the free market&#8212;the information required for discovering the optim=
al

way of protecting natural rights.

</p><center><b>Legal Principles</b></center>





<p>&nbsp;



</p><p><b>I (natural rights)</b>



</p><p>Every person shall be free to:

</p><dir>

<dir>1. form his own opinions;



<p>2. control the actions and labour of his own body;



</p><p>3. use any object not belonging to others and make it his property;



</p><p>4. make voluntary agreements with others; and



</p><p>5. defend these freedoms.</p></dir>

</dir>

<b>II (natural obligations)</b>



<p>Every person shall respect the rights of others, and therefore refrain

from:

</p><dir>

<dir>1. using force or threats thereof against peaceful persons or their

rightfully obtained possessions; and



<p>2. disposing otherwise of other people&#x27;s property without their per=
mission.</p></dir>

</dir>

<b>III (remedies)</b>



<p>Every person who violates someone&#x27;s natural rights shall:

</p><dir>

<dir>1. immediately cease violating them;



<p>2. return the goods thereby alienated;



</p><p>3. compensate the victim for damage inflicted and profits foregone;



</p><p>4. pay fines to the victim for willful infringement of his rights.</=
p></dir>

</dir>

<b>IV (fines)</b>



<p>If the parties concerned fail to agree on the nature or extent of the

fine, it shall be determined by an independent and impartial court of law

on the basis of the seriousness of the crime and the circumstances under

which it was committed.



</p><p><b>V (sanction)</b>



</p><p>Every person who refuses to remedy the rights he violated loses, to

the benefit of his victim and to the extent required for remedy, his right

to dispose of his freedom and property, as long as he persists in his refus=
al.



</p><p><b>VI (force)</b>



</p><p>Every person shall be free to defend his natural rights by using for=
ce

against his attacker and to call upon police to restore them. In the absence

of an impartial judiciary and police, every person shall be free, subject

to his liability for his own violations, to use force himself to restore

his violated rights.



</p><p><b>VII (the police)</b>



</p><p>The police, including the military, shall not use force save when an

independent and impartial court of law has verified that it is used:

</p><dir>

<dir>1. at the request of a person whose rights have been violated;



<p>2. against the person who violated them;



</p><p>3. for the sole purpose of remedying such violation;



</p><p>4. with the least violent means available; and



</p><p>5. after the violator has refused to comply voluntarily.</p></dir>

</dir>

<b>VIII (the judiciary)</b>



<p>Every person shall be free to exercise the profession of judge. Judges

shall judge only on the basis of facts as presented, not on a person&#x27;s

opinions, achievements, or bodily characteristics. Judges shall only author=
ise

the imposition of obligations that are derived from natural rights.



</p><p><b>IX (government)</b>



</p><p>Government shall consist of all the courts of law and police forces,

including the military, that operate in a free market. Its function shall

be to adjudicate and enforce natural rights, including the right to compete

in the business of supplying government services.



</p><p><b>X (government rules)</b>



</p><p>The rules made by government are either: (1) contrary to natural law

and therefore null and void, (2) identical to natural law and therefore

superfluous, (3) compatible with natural law and binding only upon those

people who knowingly and voluntarily accepted them.

</p><center><b>Rights</b></center>

&nbsp;



<p>From these legal principles, the following rights are derived. First,

a set of rights that apply to adults. Then the rights pertaining to children

and one special right pertaining to women. Rights not listed shall be upheld

only if they are consistent with the principles set forth above.



</p><p>Every person shall be free:

</p><dir>

<dir>1. to live according to his own, peaceful beliefs;



<p>2. to express, in his own language and manner, his thoughts and opinions;



</p><p>3. to reside in any country, and to move in and out of it along with

his possessions, provided he poses no physical danger;



</p><p>4. to enjoy the privacy of his home, business, papers, and effects,

including his mail and telecommunications;



</p><p>5. to found a family and to raise and educate his children according

to his own insights, if he finds a willing mate;



</p><p>6. to assemble with any others and to join and resign from any volun=
tary

association;



</p><p>7. to offer his services to people of his choice;



</p><p>8. to break any employment contract as long as he honours its perfor=
mance

bond;



</p><p>9. to undertake any economic activity, including the adjudication or

enforcement of natural rights, and to keep its profits;



</p><p>10. to sell, buy, lease, rent, lend, borrow, retain, or give away pr=
operty

by mutual agreement;



</p><p>11. to exploit his land and waters, and any material in them;



</p><p>12. to repossess the land, buildings, and other property taken from

him in violation of natural rights;



</p><p>13. to prevent others from spoiling his property by polluting it;



</p><p>14. to criticise or petition any government institution and avail hi=
mself

of any services it offers;



</p><p>15. to keep and bear arms, excluding weapons of mass destruction;



</p><p>16. to use force himself when his rights are in clear and present da=
nger;



</p><p>17. to dissolve any government institution which systematically viol=
ates

natural rights.</p></dir>

</dir>

Children shall enjoy the same freedom as adults except for restrictions

imposed by their parents in the interest of their safety, health, and devel=
opment.

Children become adults when they behave as adults. Children are entitled

to receive from their parents: food, clothing, shelter, health care, and

education. Parents shall not be liable for the activities of their children

unless they could have prevented them. Contracts concluded by a child may

be dissolved by a court of justice at the request of the child or any of

its parents. When parents are unable or unwilling to care for their child,

the child or others acting on its behalf may appeal to a court to appoint

a legal guardian who will assume the parental rights and responsibilities.



<p>Women shall be free to abort their pregnancies, at their own discretion

and expense.

nating

any litigation before a judge of their choice;

 a

jury has not been granted;



</p><p>1.3 to be informed, in writing and in a language which he understand=
s,

of the nature and cause of the charges against him;



</p><p>1.4 to try to refute those charges (but no plea of ignorance of natu=

of the reason and nature of the charges against him;



</p><p>2.6 be released from detention when the court finds the charges lack=

</dir>

3. Every person convicted of having violated a natural right shall be entit=
led:

<dir>

<dir>3.1 to be informed, in writing, and in a language which he understands,

ily.</p></dir>

</p><p>6.3 arrest his attacker caught red-handed;

ringed

whenever these assets risk disappearing before a police or judicial agency

can secure them;



</p><p>6.5 conserve proof or evidence; provided that an impartial court of

proof or evidence is or was at risk of being lost and (2) the least violent

means available will be, or were, used.</p></dir>

</dir>

</dir>

8. Every parent whose child&#x27;s natural rights have been violated shall=

involved, the costs incurred by the courts for dispensing justice, as well

as any legal costs of the litigants, shall be borne by the defendant if

he is convicted, and by the plaintiff if the defendant is acquitted. <font=
