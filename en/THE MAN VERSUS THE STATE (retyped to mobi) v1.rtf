\par established and made clear the fundamental principle that

\par minimum, and the raising of social\'b7power to its maximum;

\par Spencer's work of 1851 is long out of print and out of
\par currency; a copy of it is extremely hard to find. It should
\par be republished, for it is to the philosophy of individualism
\par what the work of the German idealist philosophers i8 to the

\par theory, or what the Pauline Epistles are to the theology of

\par the riotous progress of Statism in England; still less in
\par staying the calamitous consequences of that progress. From
\par 1851 down to his death at the end of the century, Spencer
\par wrote occasional essays, partly as running comment on the

\par accurate prophecy of what has since come to pass in consequence

\par made some minor changes, and for reasons of his own-reasons which
\par have never been made clear or satisfactorily accounted for-he vacated
\par one position which he held in 1851, and one which is most important
\par to his general doctrine of individualism. It is needless to say that in
\par abandoning a position, for any reason or for no reason, one is quite
\par within one's rights; but it must also be observed that the abandonment
\par of a position does not in itself affect the position's validity. It serves
\par merely to raise the previous question whether the position is or is not
\par valid. Galileo's disavowal of Copernican astronomy, for example, does
\par no more, at most, than send one back to a reexamination of the
\par Copernican system. To an unprejudiced mind, Spencer's action in

is of primary importance
\par just now, because it shows the contrast between the
\par aims and methods of early Liberalism and those of modern
\par Liberalism. In these days we hear a great deal about Liberalism,
\par Liberal principles and policies, in the conduct of
\par our public life. All sorts and conditions of men put themselves
\par forward on the public stage as Liberals.; they call
\par those who oppose the:mTories, and get credit with the public
\par thereby. In the public mind, Liberalism is a term of honour,
\par while Toryism---:.especially "economic Toryism' '-is. a term
\par of reproach. Needless to say, these terms are never examined;
\par the self-styled Liberal is taken popularly at the face
\par value of his pretensions, and policies which are put forth
\par as Liberal are accepted in the same unreflecting way. This
\par being so, it is useful to see what the historic sense of the
\par term is, and to see how far the aims and methods of latterday
\par Liberalism can be brought into correspondence with it;
\par and how far, therefore, the latter-day Liberal is. entitled to
\par bear that name.
\par Spencer shows that the early Liberal was consistently
\par for cutting down the State's coercive power over the citizen,
\par wherever this was possible. He was for reducing to a
\par minimum the number of points at which the State might
\par make coercive interventions upon the individual. He was
\par for steadily enlarging the margin of existence within which
\par the citizen might pursue and regulate his own activities as
\par he saw fit, free of, State control or State supervision. Liberal
\par policies and measures, as originally conceived, were such as
\par reflected these aims. The Tory, on the other hand, was
\par x INTRODUCTION.
\par opposed to these aims, and his policies reflected this opposition.
\par In general terms, the Liberal was consistently inclined
\par towards the individualist philosophy of society, while the
\par Tory was consistently inclined towards the Statist philosophy.
\par Spencer shows moreover that as a matter\'b7 of practical
\par policy, the early Liberal proceeded towards the realization
\par of his aims by the method of repeal. He was not for making
\par new laws, but for repealing old ones. It is most important
\par to remember this. Wherever the Liberal saw a law which
\par enhanced the State's coercive power over the citizen, he was
\par for repealing it and leaving its place blank. There were
\par many such laws on the British statute-books, and when Liberalism
\par came .into power it repealed an immense grist of
\par them.
\par Spencer must be left to describe in his own words, as he
\par does in the course of this essay, how in the latter half of the
\par last century British Liberalism went over bodily to the philosophy
\par of Statism, and abjuring the political method of repealing
\par existent coercive measures, proceeded to outdo the
\par Tories in constructing new coercive measures of ever-increasing
\par particularity. This piece of British political history has
\par great value for American readers, because it enables them to
\par ~ee how closely American Liberalism has followed the same
\par ~OUli'se. It enables them to interpret correctly the significance
\par of Liberalism's influence upon the direction of our
\par public life in the last half-century, and to perceive just what
\par it is to which that influence has led, just what the consequences
\par are which that influence has tended to bring about,
\par and just what are the further consequences which may be
\par expected to ensue.
\par For example, Statism postulates the doctrine that the
\par citizen has no rights which the State is bound to respect;
\par the only rights he has are those which the State grants him,
\par and which the State may attenuate or revoke at its own
\par pleasure. This doctrine is fundamental; without its support,
\par all the various nominal modes or forms of Statism
\par INTRODUCTION. xi
\par which we see at large in Europe and America-such as are
\par called Socialism, Communism, Naziism, Fascism, etc., would
\par collapse at once. The individualism which was professed
\par by the early. Liberals, maintained the contrary; it
\par maintained that the citizen has rights which are inviolable
\par by the State or by any other agency. This was fundamentaldoetrine;
\par without its support, obviously, every formulation
\par of individualism becomes so much waste paper.
\par Moreover, early Liberalism accepted it as not only funda..
\par mental, but also as axiomatic, self-evident. We may re..
\par member, for example, that our great charter, the Declaration
\par of Independence takes as its foundation the self-evident
\par truth of .this doctrine, asserting that man, in virtue of his
\par birth, is endowed with certain rights which are "unalienable";
\par and asserting further that it is "to secure these
\par rights" that governments are instituted among men. Political
\par literature will nowhere furnish a. more explicit disavowal
\par of the Statist philosophy than is to be found in the
\par primary postulate of the Declaration.
\par But now, in which direction has latter-day American Liberalism
\par tended? Has it tended towards an expanding }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of voluntary cooperation, or one of enforced cooperation?
\par Have its efforts been directed consistently towards
\par repealing existent measures of State coercion, or towards the
\par devising and promotion of new ones? Has it tended steadily
\par to enlarge or to reduce the margin of existence within which
\par the individual may act as he pleases? Has it contemplated
\par State intervention upon the citizen at an ever-increasing
\par number of points, or at an ever-decreasing number? In
\par short, has it consistently exhibited the philosophy of individualism
\par or the philosophy of Statism Y
\par There can be but one answer, and the facts supporting
\par it are so notorious that multiplying examples would be a
\par waste of space. To take but a single one :from among the
\par most conspicuous, Liberals worked hard-and successfullyto
\par inject the principle of absolutism into the Constitution by
\par xii INTRODUCTION.
\par means of the Income-tax Amendment. Under that Amendment
\par it is competent for Congress not only to confiscate the
\par citizen's last penny, but also to levy punitive taxation, discriminatory
\par taxation, taxation for "the equalization of
\par wealth, " or for any other purpose it sees fit to. promote.
\par Hardly could a single measure be devised which would do
\par more to clear the way for a purely Statist }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 than this
\par which puts so formidable a mechanism in the hands of the
\par State, and gives the State }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 carte blanche }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 for its employment
\par against the citizen. Again, the present Administration is
\par made up of self-styled Liberals, and its. course has been a
\par continuous triumphal advance of Statism. In a preface to
\par these essays, written in 1884, Spencer has a paragraph which
\par sums up with remarkable completeness the political history
\par of the United States during the last six years:
\par Dictatorial measures, rapidly multiplied, have tended continu~
\par ally to narrow the liberties of individuals; and have done this in
\par a double way. Regulations have been made in yearly-growing
\par numbers, restraining the citizen in directions where his actions
\par were previously unchecked, and compelling actions which previously
\par he might perform or not as he liked; and at the same time
\par heavier public burdens, chiefly local,\'b7 have further restricted his
\par freedom, by lessening that portion of his earnings which he can
\par spend as he pleases, and augmenting the portion taken from him
\par to be spent as public agents please.
\par Thus closely has the course of American Statism, from
\par 1932 to 1939, followed the course of British Statism from
\par 1860 to 1884. Considering their professions of Liberalism,
\par it would be quite appropriate and by no means inurbane, to
\par ask Mr. Roosevelt and his entourage whether they believe
\par that the citizen has any rights which the State is bound to
\par respect. Would they be willing-ex }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 animo, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 that is, and
\par not for electioneering purposes-to subscribe to the fundamental
\par doctrine of the Declaration? One would be unfeignedly
\par surprised if they were. Yet such an affirmation
\par might go some way to clarify the distinction, if there actually
\par be any, between the "totalitarian" Statism of certain
\par INTRODUCTION. xiii
\par European countries and the "denlocratic' , Statism of Great
\par Britain, France and the United States. It is commonly
\par taken for granted that there is such a distinction, but those
\par who assume this do not trouble themselves to show wherein
\par the distinction consists; and to the disinterested observer the
\par fact of its existence is, to say the least, not obvious.
\par Spencer ends }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 The New To'r'yism }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 with a prediction which
\par American readers today will find most interesting, if they
\par bear in mind that it was written fifty-five years ago in
\par England and primarily for English readers. He says:
\par The laws made by Liberals are so greatly increasing the compulsions
\par and restraints exercised over citizens, that among Conservatives
\par who suffer from this aggressiveness there is growing up
\par a tendency to resist it. Proof is furnished by the fact that the
\par , 'Liberty and .Property Defense League" largely consisting of
\par Conservatives, has taken for its motto, "Individualism }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 versus
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Socialism." So that if the present drift of things continues, it
\par may by-and-by really happen that the Tories will be defenders of
\par liberties which the Liberals, in pursuit of what they think popular
\par welfare, trample under foot.
\par This prophecy has already been fulfilled in the United
\par States.
\par III.
\par These essays following }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 The New Toryism }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 seem to require
\par no special introduction or explanation. They are largely
\par occupied with the various reasons why rapid social deterioration
\par has ensued upon the progress of Statism, and why,
\par unless that progress be checked, there must ensue a further
\par steady deterioration ending in disintegration. All the
\par American reader need do as he goes through these essays is
\par to draw a continuous parallel with Statism's pliogress in the
\par United States, and to remark at every page the force and
\par accuracy of Spencer's forecast, as\'b7 borne out by the unbroken
\par sequence of events since his essays were written. The
\par reader can see plainly what that sequence has run up to in
\par xiv INTRODUCTION.
\par England-a condition in which social power has been so far
\par confiscated and converted into State power that there is now
\par not enough of it left to pay the State's bills; and in which,
\par by necessary consequence, the citizen is on a footing of complete
\par and abject State-slavery. The reader will also perceive
\par what he has no doubt already suspected, that this condition
\par now existing in England is one for which there is apparently
\par no help. Even a successful revolution, if such a thing were
\par conceivable, against the military tyranny which is Statism's
\par last expedient, would accomplish nothing. The people would
\par be as thoroughly indoctrinated with Statism after the revolution
\par as they were before, and therefore the revolution would
\par be no revolution, but a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 coup d'Etat, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 by which the citizen
\par would gain nothing but a mere change of oppressors. There
\par have been many revolutions in the last twenty-five years, and
\par this has been the sum of their history. They amount to no
\par more than an impressive testimony to. the great truth that
\par there can be no right action except there be right thinking
\par behind it. As long as the easy, attractive, superficial philosophy
\par of Statism remains in control of the citizen's mind, no
\par beneficent social change can be effected, whether by revolution
\par or by any other means.
\par The reader may be left to construct for himself whatever
\par conclusions he sees fit concerning conditions now prevailing
\par in the United States, and to make what inferences he thinks
\par reasonable concerning those to which they would naturally
\par be leading. It seems highly probable that these essays will
\par be of great help to him; greater help, perhaps, than any
\par other single work that could be put before him.

\par THE NEW TORYISM.
\par MOST of those who now pass as Liberals, are Tories of a
\par new type. This is a paradox which I propose to justify.
\par That I may justify it, I must first point out what the two
\par political parties originally were; and I must then ask the
\par reader to bear with me while I remind him of facts he is
\par familiar with, that I may impress on him the intrinsic na...
\par tures of Toryisrn and Liberalism properly so called.
\par Dating back to an earlier period than their names, the two
\par political parties at first stood respectively for two opposed
\par types of social organization, broadly distinguishable as the
\par militant and the industrial-types which are characterized,
\par the one by the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Tegime }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of status, almost universal in ancient
\par days, and the other by the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Tegime }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of contract, which has
\par become general in modern days, chiefly alnong the Western
\par nations, and especially among ourselves and the Americans.
\par If, instead of using the word" co-operation" in a limited
\par sense, we use it in its widest sense, as signifying the combined
\par activities of citizens under whatever system of regulation
\par ; then these two are definable as the system of compulsory
\par co-operation and the system of voluntary co-operation. The
\par typical structure of the one we see in an arlny formed of conscripts,
\par in which the units in their several grades have to
\par fulfil commands under pain of death, and receive food and
\par 2 THE MAN }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 VERSUS }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 THE STATE.
\par clothing and pay, arbitrarily apportioned; while the typical
\par structure of the other we see in a body of producers or distributors,
\par who severally agree to specified payments in return
\par for specified services, and may at will, after due notice, leave
\par the organization if they do not like it.
\par During social evolution in England, the distinction between
\par these two fundalnentally-opposed forms of co-operation,
\par made its appearance gradually; but .long before the names
\par Tory and Whig came into use, the parties were becoming
\par traceable, and their connexions with militancy and industrialism
\par respectively, were vaguely shown. The truth is familiar
\par that, here as elsewhere, it was habitually by town-populations,
\par formed of workers and traders accustomed to co-operate
\par under contract, that resistances were made to that coercive
\par rule which characterizes co-operation under status. While,
\par conversely, co-operation under status, arising from, and adjusted
\par to, chronic warfare, was supported in rural districts,
\par originally peopled by military chiefs and their dependents,
\par where the primitive ideas and traditions survived. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 More}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 over,
\par this contrast in political leanings, shown before Whig
\par and Tory principles became clearly distinguished, continued
\par to be shown afterwards. At the period of the Revolution,
\par "while the villages and smaller towns were monopolized by
\par Tories, the larger cities, the manufacturing districts, and the
\par ports of commerce, formed the strongholds of the Whigs."
\par And that, spite of exceptions, the like general relation still ex..
\par ists, needs no proving.
\par Such were the natures of the two parties as indicated by
\par their origins. Observe, now, ho"\\v their natures were indicated
\par by their early doctrines and deeds. Whiggism began
\par with resistance to Charles }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 II. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 and his cabal, in their efforts
\par to re-establish unchecked monarchical power. The Whigs
\par "regarded the monarchy as a civil institution, established by
\par the nation for the benefit of all its menlbers ;" while with the
\par Tories "the monarch was the delegate of heaven." And
\par these doctrines involved the beliefs, the one that subjection
\par THE NEW TORYISM. 3
\par of citizen to ruler was conditional, and the other that it was
\par unconditional. Describing Whig and Tory as conceived at
\par the end of the seventeenth century, some fifty years before
\par he wrote his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Di88ertation on Partie8, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Bolingbroke says :-
\par "The power and majesty of the people, and original contract, the

\par and inconsistent with the idea of a Tory.
\par "Divine, hereditary, indefeasible right, lineal succession, passive

\par And if we compare these descriptions, we see that in the one
\par party there was a desire to resi.st and decrease the coercive
\par power of the ruler over the subject, and in the other party to
\par maintain or increase his coercive power. This distinction in
\par their aims-a distinction which transcends in meaning and

\par bidding combinations among artisans as well as of those
\par which interfered with their freedom of travelling. There
\par was the measure by which, under Whig pressure, Dissenters
\par were allowed to believe as they pleased without suffering
\par certain civil penalties; and there was the Whig measure,
\par carried by Tories under cOlnplllsion, which enabled Oatholics
\par to profess their religion without losing part of their freedom.
\par The area of liberty was extended by Acts which forbade the
\par buying of. negroes and the holding of them in bondage. The
\par East India Oompany's monopoly was abolished, and trade
\par with the East Inade open to all. The political serfdom of
\par the unrepresented ,vas narrowed in area, both by the Reform
\par Bill and the Municipal Reform Bill; so that alike generally
\par and locally, the many were less under the coercion of the
\par few. Dissenters, no longer obliged to submit to the ecclesiastical
\par form of marriage, were made free towed by a purely
\par civil rite. Later came diminution and removal of restraints
\par on the buying of foreign commodities and the ernployment
\par of foreign vessels and foreign sailors; and later still the re-.
\par moval 0:\'a3 those burdens on the press, which were originally
\par imposed to hinder the diffusion of opinion. And of all
\par THE NEW TORYISM. 5
\par these changes it is unquestionable that, whether made or not
\par by Liberals themselves, they were made in conformity with
\par principles professed and urged by Liberals.
\par But why do I enumerate facts so well known to all ~
\par Simply because, as intimated at the outset, it seems needful
\par to remind everybody what Liberalism was in the past, that
\par they may perceive its unlikeness to the so-called Liberalism
\par of the present. It would be inexcusable to name these
\par various measures for the purpose of pointing out the character
\par common to theIn, were it not that in our day men have for...
\par gotten their common character. They do not remember that,
\par in one or other way, all these tru.ly Liberal changes diminished
\par compulsory co-operation throughout social life and increased
\par voluntary co-operation. They have forgotten that, in one
\par direction or other, they diminished the range of governmental
\par authority, and increased the area within which each citizen
\par may act unchecked. They have lost sight of the truth that
\par in past times Liberalism habitually stood for individual freedom
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 versus }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 State-coercion.
\par And now comes the inquiry--How is it that Liberals have
\par lost sight of this? How is it that Liberalism, getting more
\par and more into power, has grown more and more coercive in
\par its legislation ~ How is it that, either directly through its
\par own majorities or indirectly through aid given in such cases
\par to the majorities of its opponents, Liberalism has to an
\par increasing extent adopted the policy of dictating the actions
\par of citizens, and, by consequence, diminishing the range
\par throughout which their actions remain free? How are we
\par to explain this spreading confusion of thought which has
\par led it, in pursuit of what appears to be public good, to invert
\par the method by which in earlier days it achieved public
\par good?
\par Unaccountable as at first sight this unconscious change of
\par policy seems, we shall find that :it has arisen quite naturally.

\par was to be expected. To make this clear some parenthetic
\par explanations are needful.
\par Froin the lowest to the highest creatures, intelligence pro~
\par gresses by acts of discrimination; and it continues so to
\par progress among men, from the most ignorant to the most
\par cultured. To class rightly-to put in the same group
\par things which are of essentially th8 same natures, and in other
\par groups things of natures essentially different-is the fundamental
\par condition to right guidance of actions. Beginning
\par with rudirnentary vision, which gives warning that some
\par large opaque body is passing near (just as closed eyes turned
\par to the ,vindow, perceiving the shade caused by a hand put
\par before them, tell us of something moving in front), the
\par advance is to developed vision, ,vhich, by exactly-appreciated
\par combinations of forms, colours, and motions, identifies objects
\par at great distances as prey or enemies, and so makes it possible
\par to improve the adjustments of conduct for securing food or
\par evading death. That progressing perception of differences
\par and consequent greater correctness of classing, constitutes,
\par under one of its chief aspects, the growth of intelligence, is
\par equally seen when we pass from the relatively silnple
\par physical vision to the relatively complex intellectual vision
\par -the vision through the agency of which, things previously
\par grouped by certain external reselnblances or by certain
\par extrinsic circumstances, come to be more truly grouped in
\par conformity with their intrinsic structures or natures. Un..
\par developed intellectual vision is just as indiscriminating and
\par erroneous in its classings as undeveloped physical vision.
\par Instance the early arrangement }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 plants into the groups,
\par trees, shrubs, and herbs: size, the most conspicuous trait,
\par being the ground of distinction; and the assenlblages formed
\par being such as united many plants extremely unlike in their
\par natures, and .separated others that are near akin. Or still
\par better, take the popular classification which puts together
\par under the same general name, fish and shell-fish, and under
\par THE NEW TORYISM. 7
\par the sub-name, shell-fish, puts together crustaceans and mol..
\par luscs; nay, which goes further, and regards as fish the cetacean
\par mammals. Partly because of the likeness in their
\par modes of life as inhabiting the water, and partly because of
\par SOlne general resemblance in their flavours, creatures that
\par are in their essential natures far more widely separated than
\par a fish is from a bird, are associated. in the Bame clasB and in
\par the same sub-class.
\par Now the general truth thus exemplified, holds throughout
\par those higher ranges of intellectual vision concerned with
\par things not presentable to the senses, and, among others, such
\par things as\'b7 political institutions and political measures. For
\par when thinking of these, too, the results of inadequate intellectual
\par faculty, or inadequate culture of it, or both, are
\par erroneous classings and consequent erroneous conclusions.
\par Indeed, the liability to error is here much greater; since the
\par things with which the intellect is concerned do not admit of
\par examination in the same easy way. You cannot touch or
\par see a political institution: it can be known only by an effort
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 constructive imagination. Neither can you apprehend by
\par physical perception a political measure: this no less requires
\par a process of mental representation by which its elements are
\par put together in thought, and the essential nature of the combination
\par conceived. Here, therefore, still more than in the
\par cases above named, defective intellectual vision is shown in
\par grouping by external characters, or extrinsic circumstances.
\par How institutions are wrongly classed from this cause, we see
\par in the common notion that the Roman Republic was a popular
\par form of government. Look into the early ideas of the
\par French revolutionists who aimed at an ideal state of freedom,
\par and you find that the political forms and deeds of the Romans
\par were their models; and even now a historian might be
\par named who instances the corruptions of the Roman Republic
\par as showing us what popular governlnent leads to. Yet the
\par resemblance between the institutions of the Romans and free
\par institutions properly so-called, was less than that between a

\par shark and a porpoise-a resemblance of general external form
\par accolupanying widely different internal structures. For the
\par ROlnan Governnlent was that of a small oligarchy within a
\par larger oligarchy: the members of each being unchecked autocrats.
\par A society in which the relatively few men who had
\par political power, and were in a qualified sense free, were so
\par many petty despots, holding not only slaves and dependents
\par but even children in a bondage no less absolute than that in
\par which they held their cattle, was, by its intrinsic nature,
\par more nearly allied to an ordinary despotism than to a society
\par of citizens politically equal.
\par Passing now to our special question, we may understand
\par the kind of confusion in which Liberalism has lost itself:
\par and the origin of those mistaken classings of political measures
\par which have misled it-classings, as we shall see, by conspicuous
\par external traits instead of by internal natures. For
\par what, in the popular apprehension and in the apprehension
\par of those who.effected them, were the changes made by Liberals
\par in the past ~ They were abolitions of grievances suffered
\par by the people, or by portions of them: this was the
\par common trait they had which most impressed itself on men's
\par minds. They were mitigations of evils which had directly
\par or indirectly been felt by large classes of citizens, as causes
\par to misery\'b7 or as hindrances to happiness. And since, in the
\par minds of most, a rectified evil is equivalent to an achieved
\par good, these measures came to be thought of as so many positive
\par benefits; and the welfare of the many came to be conceived
\par alike by Liberal statesmen and Liberal voters as the
\par aim of Liberalism. Hence the confusion. The gaining of
\par a popular good, being the external conspicuous trait common
\par to Liberal measures in earlier days (then in each case gained
\par by a relaxation of restraints), it has happened that popular
\par good has come to be sought by Liberals, not as an end to be
\par indirectly gained by relaxations of restraints, but as the end to
\par be directly gained. And seeking to gain it directly, they have
\par used methods intrinsically opposed to those originally used.
\par THE NEW TORYISM. 9
\par And now, having\'b7 seen how this reversal of policy has
\par arisen (or partial reversal, I should say, for the recent Burials
\par Act and the efforts to remove all remaining religious inequalities,
\par show continuance of the original policy in certain directions),
\par let us proceed to contemplate the extent to which it
\par has been carried during recent times, and the still greater
\par extent to which the future \'b7will see it carried if current ideas
\par and feelings continue to predominate.
\par Before proceeding, it may be well to say that no reflections
\par are intended on the mothres which prompted one after
\par another of these various restraints and dictations. These
\par motives were doubtle8sin nearly all cases good. It must be
\par admitted that the restrictions placed by an Act of 18'70, on
\par the ernployment of women and children in Turkey-red dyeing
\par works, were, in intention, no less philanthropic than those of
\par Edward VI., which prescribed the minimum time for which
\par a journeymen should be retained. Without question, the
\par Seed Supply (Ireland) Act of 1880, which empowered guardians
\par to buy seed }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 for }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 poor tenants, and then to see it properly
\par planted, was moved by a desire for public welfare no less
\par great than that which in 1533 prescribed the number of
\par sheep a tenant might keep, or that of 1597, which commanded
\par that decayed houses of husbandry should be rebuilt.
\par Nobody will dispute that the various measures of late years
\par taken for .restricting the sale of intoxicating liquors, have
\par been taken as much with a view to public morals as were the
\par measures taken }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 old for checking the evils of luxury; as,
\par for instance, in the fourteenth century, when diet as well as
\par dress\'b7 was restricted. Everyone must see that the edicts
\par issued by Henry VIII. to prevent the lower classes from
\par playing dice, cards, bowls, &c., were not nlore prolnpted by
\par desire for popular welfare than were the acts passed of late
\par to check gambling.
\par Further, I do not intend here to question the wisdom }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 these modern interferences, which Conservatives and Liberals

\par vie with one and other in multiplying, any more than to ques\'b7
\par tion the wisdom of those ancient ones which they in many
\par cases resemble. We will not now consider whether the plans
\par of late adopted for preserving the lives of sailors, are or are
\par not more judicious than that sweeping Scotch measure
\par which, in the middle of the fifteenth century, prohibited
\par captains from leaving harbor during the winter. For the
\par present, it shall remain undebated whether there is a better
\par warrant for giving sanitary officers powers to se~rch certain
\par premises for unfit food, than there was for the law of
\par Edward III., under which innkeepers at seaports were sworn
\par to search their guests to prevent the exportation of money or
\par plate. We will assume that there is no less sense in that
\par clause of the Canal-boat Act, 'which forbids an owner to
\par board gratuitously the children of the boatmen, than there
\par was in the Spitalfields Acts, which, up to 1824, for the benefit
\par of the artisans, forbade the manufacturers to fix their factories
\par more than ten miles from the Royal Exchange.
\par We exclude, then, these questions of philanthropic motive
\par and wise judgment, taking both of them for granted; and
\par have here to concern ourselves solely with the compulsory
\par nature of the measures which, for good or evil as the case
\par may be, have been put in force during periods of Liberal
\par ascendency.
\par To bring the illustrations within compass, let us commence
\par with 1860, under the second administration of Lord
\par Palmerston. In that year, the restrictions of the Factories
\par Act were extended to bleaching and dyeing works; authority
\par was given to provide analysts of food and drink, to
\par be paid out of local rates; there was an Act providing for
\par inspection of gas-works, as well as for fixing quality of gas
\par and limiting price; there was the Act which, in addition to
\par further mine-inspection, made it penal to employ boys under
\par twelve not attending school and unable to read and write.
\par In 1861 occurred an extension of the compulsory provisions
\par of the Factories Act to lace-works; power was given to poor~
\par THE NEW TORYISM. 11
\par law guardians, &c., to enforce vaccination; local boards were
\par authorized to fix rates of hire for horses, ponies, mules, asses,
\par and boats; and certain locally-formed bodies had given to
\par them powers of taxing the locality for rural drainage and
\par irrigation works, and for supplying water to cattle. In
\par 1862 an Act was passed for restricting the employment of
\par women g,nd children in open-g,ir bleaching; and\'b7 an .Act for
\par making illegal a coal-mine with a single shaft, or with shafts
\par separated by less than a specified space; as well as an Act
\par giving the Council of Medical Education the exclusive right
\par to publish a Pharmacopreia, the price of which is to be fixed
\par by the Treasury. In 1863 came the extension of compulsory
\par vaccination to Scotland, and also to Ireland; there came the
\par empowering of certain boards to borrow money repayable
\par from the local rates, to employ and pay those out of work;
\par there came the authorizing of town-authorities to take possession
\par of neglected ornamental spaces, and rate the inhabitant&
\par for their support; there came the Bakehouses Regulation
\par Act, which, besides specifying minimum age of employes
\par occupied between certain hours, prescribed periodical limewashing,
\par three coats of paint when painted, and cleaning with
\par hot water and soap at least once in six months; and there
\par came also an Act giving a magistrate authority to decide on
\par the wholesorneness or unwholesolueness of food brought before
\par him by an inspector. Of compulsory legislation dating
\par from 1864, may be named an extension of the Factories Act
\par to various additional trades, including regulations for cleansing
\par and ventilation, and specifying of certain employes in
\par match-works, that they might not take meals on the premises
\par except in the wood-cutting places. Also there were passed a
\par Chimney-Sweepers Act, an Act for further regulating the
\par sale of beer in Ireland, an Act for compulsory testing of cables
\par and anchors, an Act extending the Public Works Act of 1863,
\par and the Contagious Diseases Act: which last gave the police,
\par in specified places, powers which, in respect of certain classes
\par of women, abolished sundry of those safeguards to individual

\par further provision for the reception and temporary relief of
\par wanderers at the cost of ratepayers; another public-house
\par closing Act; and an Act making compulsory regulations for
\par extinguishing fires in London. Then, under the Ministry }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Lord John Russell, in 1866, have to be named an Act to
\par regulate cattle-sheds, &c., in Scotland, giving local authorities
\par powers to inspect sanitary conditions and fix the nunlbers of
\par cattle; an Act forcing hop-growers to label their bags with
\par the year and place of growth and the true weight, and giving
\par police powers of search; an Act to facilitate the building of
\par lodging-houses in Ireland, and providing for regulation of the
\par inmates; a Public Health Act, under which there is registration
\par of lodging-houses and limitation of occupants, with
\par inspection and directions for lime-washing, &c., and a Public
\par Libraries Act, giving local powers by which a majority can
\par tax a minority for their books.
\par Passing now to the legislation under the first Ministry of
\par Mr. Gladstone, we have, in 1869, the establishlnent of Statetelegraphy,
\par with the accompanying interdict on telegraphing
\par through any other agency; we have the empowering a Secretaryof
\par State to regulate hired conveyances in London; we
\par have further and more stringent regulations to prevent cattlediseases
\par from spreading, another Beerhouse Regulation Act,
\par and a Sea-birds Preservation Act (ensuring greater mortality
\par of fish). In 1870 we have a law authorizing the Board of
\par Public Works to make advances for landlords' improvements
\par and for purchase by tenants; we have the Act which enables
\par the Education Departlnent to form school-boards which shall
\par purchase sites for schools, and may provide free schools
\par supported by local rates, and enabling school-boards to pay a
\par child's fees, to compel parents to send their children, &c., &c.;
\par we have a further Factories and Workshops Act, making,
\par among other restrictions, some on the employment of women
\par and children in fruit-preserving and fish-curing works. In
\par 1871 we met with an amended Merchant Shipping Act,
\par THE NEW TORYISM. 13
\par directing officers of the Board of Trade to record the draught
\par of sea-going vessels leaving port; there is another Factory
\par and Workshops Act, making further restrictions; there is a
\par Pedlars Act, inflicting penalties for hawking without a
\par certificate, and limiting the district within which the certi.
\par ficate holds as well as giving the police power to search
\par pedlars' packs; and there are further llleasures for entorcing
\par vaccination. The year 1872 had, among other Acts, one
\par which makes it illegal to take for hire more than one child
\par to nurse, unless in a house registered by the authorities, who
\par prescribe the number of infants to be received; it had a
\par Licensing Act, interdicting sale of spirits to those apparently
\par under sixteen; and it had another Merchant Shipping Act,
\par establishing an annual survey of passenger steamers. Then
\par in 1873 was passed the Agricultural Children's Act, which
\par makes\'b7 it penal for a farmer to employ a child who has
\par neither certificate of elementary education nor of certain
\par prescribed school-attendances; and there was passed a
\par Merchant Shipping Act, requiring on each vessel a scale
\par showing draught and giving the Board of Trade power to fix
\par the numbers of boats and life-saving appliances to be carried.
\par Turn now to Liberal law-making under the present Minis..
\par try. We have, in 1880, a law which forbids conditional advance-
\par notes in payment of sailors' wages; also a law which
\par dictates certain arrangements for the safe carriage of graincargoes;
\par also a law increasing local coercion over parents to
\par send their children to school. In 1881con1es legislation to
\par prevent trawling over clam-beds and bait-beds, and an interdict
\par making it impossible to buy a glass }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 beer on Sunday in Wales.
\par In 1882 the Board of Trade was authorized to grant licences
\par to generate and sell electricity, and municipal bodies ,vere enabled
\par to levy rates for electric-lighting: further exactions
\par from ratepayers were authorized for facilitating more acces\'b7

\par legislation during 1883 may be named the Cheap Trains Ac11
\par which, partly by taxing the nation to the' extent of \'a3400,000
\par a year (in the shape of relinquished passenger duty), and
\par partly at the cost of railway-proprietors, still further cheapens
\par travelling for workmen: the Board of Trade, through the
\par Railway Oommissioners, being empowered to ensure sufficiently
\par good and frequent accommodation. Again, there is
\par the Act which, under penalty of \'a310 for disobedience, forbids
\par the payment of wages to workmen at or within public-houses;
\par there is another Factory and Workshops Act, conlmanding
\par inspection of white lead works (to see that there are provided

\par of bakehouses, regulating times of employment in both, and
\par prescribing in detail some constructions for the last, which
\par are to be kept in a condition satisfactory to the inspectors.

\par is-~' Hitherto you have been free to spend this portion of
\par your earnings in any way which pleased you; hereafter you
\par shall not be free so to spend it, but we will spend it for the
\par general benefit." Thus, either directly or indirectly, and in
\par most cases both at once, the citizen is at each further stage
\par in the growth of this compulsory legislation, deprived of
\par some liberty which he previously had.
\par Such, then, are the doings of the party which claims the
\par name of Liberal; and which calls itself Liberal as being the
\par advocate of extended freedom!
\par I doubt not that many a member of the party has read the
\par preceding section with impatience: wanting, as he does, to
\par point out an immense oversight which he thinks destroys the
\par validity of the argument. " You forget," he wishes to say,
\par " the fundamental difference between the power which, in the
\par past, established those restraints that Liberalism abolished,
\par and the power which, in the present, establishes the restraints
\par you call anti-Liberal. You forget that the one was an irre..
\par sponsible power, while the other is a responsible power. You
\par forget that if by the recent legislation of Liberals, people are
\par variously regulated, the body which regulates them is of their
\par own creating, and has their warrant for its acts."
\par My answer is, that I have not forgotten this difference,
\par but am prepared to contend that the difference is in large
\par measure irrelevant to the issue.
\par In the first place, the real issue is whether the lives of
\par citizens are more interfered with than they were; not the
\par nature of the agency which interferes with them. Take a
\par simpler case. .A. member of a trades' union has joined others
\par in establishing an organization of a purely representative

\par character. By it he is compelled to strike if a majority so
\par decide; he is forbidden to accept work save under the conditions
\par they dictate; he is prevented from profiting by his
\par superior ability or energy to the extent he might do were it
\par not for their interdict. He cannot disobey without abandoning
\par those pecuniary benefits of the organization for which he
\par has sub~cl'ib~d, n.nd bringing on himself the persecution, and
\par perhaps violence, of his fellows. Is he any the less coerced
\par because the body coercing hin1 is one which he had an equal
\par voice with the rest in forming ~
\par In the second place, if it be objected that the analogy is
\par faulty, since the governing body of a nation, to which, as
\par protector of the national life and interests, all must submit
\par under penalty }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 social disorganization, has a far higher authority
\par over citizens than the government of any private
\par organization can have over its members; then the reply is
\par that, granting the difference, the answer made continues
\par valid. If men use their liberty in such a way as to surrender
\par their liberty, are they thereafter any the less slaves? If
\par people by a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 plebiscite }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 elect a m.an despot over theIn, do they
\par remain free because the despotism was of their own making ~
\par Are the coercive edicts issued by him to be regarded. as
\par le~itimate because they are the ultimate outcome of their
\par own votes? As well might it be argued that the East
\par African, who breaks a spear in another's presence that he
\par may so become bondsman to him, still retains his liberty
\par because he freely chose his master.
\par Finally if any, not without marks of irritation as I can
\par imagine, repudiate this reasoning, and say that there is no
\par true parallelism between the relation of people to government
\par where an irresponsible single ruler has been permanently
\par elected, and the relation where a responsible representative
\par body is maintained, and from time to time reelected;
\par then there comes the ultimate reply-an altogether
\par heterodox reply-by which most will be greatly astonished.
\par This reply is, that these multitudinous restraining acts are

\par not defensible on the ground that they proceed from a popu..

\par kind, which the Liberalism of the last generation effected,
\par were practical confessions that in these directions, too, the
\par sphere of governmental action should be narrowed. And
\par this recognition of the propriety of restricting governmental
\par action was a preparation for restricting it in theory. One of
\par the most familiar political truths is that, in the course }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 social evolution, usage precedes law; and that when usage
\par has been well established it becomes law by receiving authoritative
\par endorsement and defined form. Manifestly then,
\par Liberalism in the past, by its practice of limitation, was pre"
\par paring the way for the principle of limitation.
\par But returning from these more general considerations }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 to
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 the special question, I emphasize the reply that the liberty
\par THE NEW TORYISM. 19
\par which a citizen enjoys is to be measured, not by the nature o\'a3
\par the governmental machinery he lives under, whether representative
\par or other, but by the relative paucity of the restraints
\par it imposes on him; and that, whether this machinery is or is
\par not on'e he shared in making, its actions are not of the kind
\par proper to Liberalism if they increase such restraints beyond
\par those which are needful }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 for }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 preventing him from directly or
\par indirectly aggressing on his fellows-needful, that is, for
\par maintaining the liberties of his fellows against his invasions
\par of them: restraints which are, therefore/to be distinguished
\par as negatively coercive, not positively coercive.
\par Probably, however, the Liberal, and still more the subspecies
\par Radical, who. more than any other in these latter
\par days seems under the impression that so long as he has a
\par good end in view he is warranted in exercising over men all
\par the coercion he is able, will continue to protest. Knowing
\par that his ailn is popular benefit of some kind, to be achieved
\par in some way, and believing that the Tory is, contrariwise,
\par prompted by class-interest and the desire to maintain classpower,
\par he will regard it as palpably absurd to group him as
\par one of the same genus, and will scorn the reasoning used to
\par prove that he belongs. to it.
\par Perhaps an analogy will help him to see its validity. If,
\par away in the far East, where personal governlnent is the only
\par form of government known, he heard from the inhabitants
\par an account of a struggle by which they had deposed a cruel
\par and vicious despot, and put in his place one whose acts proved
\par his desire for their welfare-if, after listening to their se1\'a3gratulations,
\par he told them that they had not essentially
\par changed the nature of their government, he would greatly
\par astonish them; and probably he would have difficulty in
\par making them understand that the substitution of a benevolent
\par despot for a malevolent despot, still left the government
\par a despotism. Similarly with Toryism as rightly conceived.
\par Standing as it does for coercion by the State }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 versus }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 the

\par freedom of the individual, Toryism relnains Toryism, whether
\par it extends this coercion for selfish or unselfish reasons. As
\par certainly as the despot is still' a despot, whether his motives
\par for arbitrary rule are good or bad; 80 certainly is the Tory
\par still a Tory, whether he has egoistic or altruistic motives for
\par using State-power to restrict the liberty of the citizen, beyond
\par the degree required for maintaining the liberties of other
\par citizens. The altruistic Tory as well as the egoistic Tory
\par belongs to the genus Tory; though he forms a new species
\par of the genus. And both stand in distinct contrast with the
\par Liberal as defined in the days when Liberals were rightly so
\par called, and when the definition was-" one who advocates
\par greater freedom from restraint, especially in political institutions."
\par Thus, then, is justified the paradox I set out with. As we
\par have seen, Toryism and Liberalism originally emerged, the
\par one from militancy and the other from industrialism. The
\par one stood for the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of status and the other for the
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of contract-the one for that system of compulsory
\par co-operation whieh aecompanies the legal inequality of classes,
\par and the other for that voluntary co-operation which accom\'b7
\par panies their legal equality; and beyond all question the early
\par acts of the two parties were respectively :for the maintenance
\par of agencies which effect this compulsory co-operation, and
\par for the weakening or curbing of them. Manifestly the implication
\par is that, in so far as it has been extending the system
\par of compulsion, what is now called Liberalism is a new form
\par of Toryism.
\par How truly this is so, we shall see still more clearly on
\par looking at the facts the other side upwards, which we will
\par presently do.
\par NOTE.-By sundry newspapers which noticed this article
\par when it was originally published, the meaning of the above
\par paragraphs was supposed to be that Liberals and Tories have
\par THE NEW TORYISM. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 21
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 changed places. This, however, is by no mea!\}s the implication.
\par A new species of Tory rnay arise without disappearance
\par of the original species. When saying, as on page 289,
\par that in our days" Conservatives and Liberals vie with one
\par another in multiplying" interferences, I clearly inlplied the
\par belief that while Liberals have taken to coercive legislation,
\par Oonservatives have not abandoned it. Nevertheless, it is
\par true that the laws made by Liberals are so greatly increasing
\par the compulsions and restraints exercised over citizens, that
\par among Conservatives who suffer from this aggressiveness
\par there is growing up a tendency to resist it. Proof is furnished
\par by the fact that the" Liberty and Property Defense
\par League," largely consisting of Conservatives, has\'b7 taken for
\par its motto" Individualism }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 versus }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Socialism." So that if the
\par present drift of things continues, it may by and by really
\par happen that the Tories will be defenders of liberties which
\par the Liberals, in pursuit of what they think popular welfare,
\par trample under foot.

\par in this, that it idealizes its object. Sympathy with one in

\par pens that when the miseries of the poor are dilated upon,

\par "But surely we are not without responsibilities, even
\par when the suffering is that of the unworthy?"
\par If the meaning of the word " we" be so expanded as to
\par include with ourselves our ancestors, and especially our ancestral
\par legislators, I agree. I admit that those who made,
\par and modified,\'b7and administered, the old Poor Law, were responsible
\par for producing an appalling amount of demoralization,
\par which it will take more than one generation to remove.
\par I admit, too, the partial responsibility of recent and present

\par permanent body of tramps, who ramble from union to union;
\par and also their responsibility for Inaintaining a constant supply
\par of felons by sending back convicts into society under
\par such conditions that they are almost compelled again to commit
\par crimes. Moreover, I admit that the philanthropic are
\par not without their share of responsibility; since, that they
\par may aid the offspring of the unworthy, they disadvantage the
\par offspring of the worthy through burdening their parents by
\par increased local rates. Nay, I even admit that these swarms
\par of good-for-nothings, fostered and multiplied by public and

\par made to suffer more than they would otherwise have suffered.
\par Are these the responsibilities meant ~ I suspect not.
\par But now, leaving the question of responsibilities, however
\par conceived, and considering only the evil itself, what shall we
\par say of its treatment ~ Let me begin with a fact.
\par A late uncle of mine, the Rev. Thomas Spencer, for some
\par twenty years incumbent of flinton Charterhouse, near Bath,
\par no sooner entered on his parish duties than he proved himself
\par anxious for the welfare of the poor, by establishing a
\par school, a library, a clothing club, and land-allotments, besides
\par building some Inodel cottages. Moreover, up to 1833 he
\par was a pauper's friend-always for the pauper against the
\par overseer.
\par There presently came, however, the debates on the Poor
\par THE COMING SLAVERY. 25
\par Law, which impressed him with the evils of the system then
\par in force. Though an ardent philanthropist he was not a
\par timid sentimentalist. The result was that, immediately the
\par New Poor Law was passed, he proceeded to carry out its
\par provisions in his parish. Alrnost universal opposition was
\par encountered by him: not the poor only being his opponents,
\par but even the farmers on wholll came the burden of heavy
\par poor-rates. For, strange to say, their interests had become
\par apparently identified 'with the maintenance of this system
\par which taxed them so largely. The explanation is that there
\par had grown up the practice of paying out of the rates a part
\par of the wages }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 each farm-servant-" make-wages," as the
\par sum was called. And though the farmers contributed most
\par of the fund fronl which" lnake\'b7.wages" were paid, yet, since
\par all other ratepayers contributed, the farmers seemed to gain
\par by the arrangelnent. My uncle, however, not easily deterred,
\par faced all this opposition and enforced the law. The result
\par was that in two years the rates were reduced from \'a3'700 a
\par year to \'a3200 a year; while the condition of the parish was
\par greatly improved. H Those who had hitherto loitered at the
\par corners of the streets, or at the doors of the beer-shops, had
\par something else to do, and one after another they obtained
\par employment;" so that out of a population of 800, only 15
\par had to be sent as incapable paupers to the Bath Union (when
\par that was formed), in place of the 100 who received out-door
\par relief a short time before. If it be said that the \'a325 telescope
\par which, a few years after, his parishioners presented to
\par my uncle, marked the gratitude of the ratepayers only; then
\par my reply is the fact that when, some years later still, having
\par killed himself by overwork in pursuit of popular welfare, he
\par was taken to Hinton to be buried, the procession which followed
\par him to the grave included not the well-to-do only but
\par the poor.
\par Several motives have prompted this brief narrative. One

\par approval of gratuitous aids. Another is the desire to show
\par that benefit may result, not from multiplication of artificial
\par appliances to mitigate distress, but, contrariwise, froIn diminution
\par of them. And a further purpose I have in view is
\par that of preparing the way for an analogy.
\par Under another form and in a different sphere, we are now
\par yearly extending a system which is identical in nature with
\par the system of "make-wages" under the old Poor Law. Little
\par as politicians recognize the fact, it is nevertheless deulonstrable
\par that these various public appliances for working-class
\par cornfort, which they are supplying at the cost of ratepayers,
\par are intrinsically of the same nature as those which, in past
\par thnes, treated the faruler's man as half-labourer and halfpauper.
\par In either case the worker receives in return for
\par what he does, money wherewith to buy certain of the things
\par he wants; while, to procure the rest of thelu for hirn, money
\par is furnished out of a common fund raised by taxes. What
\par matters it whether the things supplied by ratepayers for
\par nothing, instead of by the employer in payment, are of this
\par kind or that kind? the principle is the same. For sums
\par received let us substitute the commodities and benefits pur\'b7
\par chased; and then see how the matter stands. In old PoorLaw
\par times, the farmer gave for work done the equivalent,
\par say of house-rent, bread, clothes, and fire; while the ratepayers
\par practically supplied the man and his family with their
\par shoes, tea, sugar, candles, a little bacon, &c. TIle division is,
\par of course, arbitrary; but unquestionably the farmer and the
\par ratepayers furnished these things between them. At the
\par present time the artisan receives from his employer in wages,
\par the equivalent of the consumable commodities he wants;
\par while from the public conles satisfaction for others of his
\par needs and desires. At the cost of ratepayers he has in some
\par cases, and will presently have in more, a house at less than
\par its commercial value; for of course when, as in Liverpool, a
\par municipality spends nearly \'a3200,000 in pulling down and
\par reconstructing low-class dwellings, and is about to spend as
\par THE COMING SLAVERY. 27
\par much again, the implication is that in some way the ratepayers
\par supply the poor with more accommodation than the
\par rents they pay 'would otherwise have brought. The artisan
\par further receives from theIn, in schooling for his children,
\par much more than he pays for; and there is every probability
\par that he will presently receive it from them gratis. The
\par ratepayers also satisfy what desire he may have for books
\par and newspapers, and comfortable places to read them in. In
\par some cases too, as in Manchester, gynlnasia for his children
\par of both sexes, as well as recreation grounds, are provided.
\par That is to say, he obtains froln a fund raised by local taxes,
\par certain benefits beyond those which the sum received for his
\par labour enables him to purchase. The sole difference, then,
\par between this system and the old system of "make-wages," is
\par between the kinds of satisfactions obtained; and this difference
\par does not in the least affect the nature of the arrangement.
\par Moreover, the two are pervaded by substantially the saIne
\par illusion. In the one case, as in the other, what looks like a
\par gratis benefit is not a gratis benefit. The amount which,
\par under the old Poor Law, the half-pauperized labourer received
\par from the parish to eke out his weekly income, was not
\par really, as it appeared, a bonus; for it was accompanied by a
\par substantially-equivalent decrease of his wages, as was quickly
\par proved when the .system was abolished and the wages rose.
\par Just so is it with these seeming boons received by working
\par people in towns. I do not refer only to the fact that they
\par unawares pay in part through the raised rents of their dwellings
\par (when they are not actnal ratepayers); but I refer to
\par the fact that the wages received by them are, like the wages
\par of the farm-labourer, diminished by these public burdens
\par falling on employers. Read the accounts coming of late from
\par Lancashire concerning the cotton-strike, containing proofs,
\par given by artisans themselves, that the margin of profit is so
\par narrow that the less skilful \'b7manufacturers, as well as those
\par with deficient capital, fail, and that the companies of co\'b7

\par operators who compete with them can rarely hold their own;
\par and then consider what is the implication respecting wages.
\par Among the costs of production have to be reckoned taxes,
\par general and local. If, as in our large towns, the local rates
\par now amount to one-third of the rental or more-if the
\par employer has to pay this, not on his private dwelling only,
\par but on his business-premises, factories, warehouses, or the
\par like; it results that the interest 011 his capital must be dimin\'b7
\par ished by that amount, or the amount must be taken from
\par the wages-fund, or partly one and partly the other. And if
\par competition among capitalists in the same business, and in
\par other businesses, has the effect of so keeping down interest
\par that while some gain others lose, and not a few are rninedif
\par capital, not getting adequate interest, flows elsewhere and
\par leaves labour unemployed; then it is manifest that the
\par choice for the artisan under such conditions, lies between
\par diminished amount of work and diminished rate of payment
\par for it. Moreover, for kindred reasons these local burdens
\par raise the costs of the things he consumes. The charges made
\par by distributors are, on the average, determined by the current
\par rates of interest on capital used in distributing businesses;
\par and the extra costs of carrying on such businesses have to be
\par paid for by extra prices So that as in the past the rural
\par worker lost in one way what he gained in another, so in the
\par present does the urban worker: there being, too, in both
\par cases, the loss entailed on him by the cost of administration
\par and the waste accompanying it.
\par " But what has all this to do with 'the coming slavery' ~ "
\par will perhaps be asked. Nothing directly, but a good deal
\par indirectly, as we shall see after yet another preliminary section.
\par It is said that when railways were first opened in Spain,

\par The incident is recalled to Dle on contemplating the ideas
\par of the so-called" practical" politician, into whose mind there
\par enters no thought of such a thing as political lTIOmentum,
\par still less of a political momentunl which, instead of diminishing
\par or remaining constant, increases. The theory on which
\par he daily proceeds is that the change caused by his measure
\par will stop where he intends it to stop. He contemplates intently
\par the things his act will achieve, but thinks little of
\par the remoter issues of the movement his act sets up, and still
\par less its collateral issues. When, in war-time, "food for
\par powder" was to be provided by encouraging populationwhen

\par are a number of children a matter of right and honour, instead

\par years, that women with rnany bastards would be preferred as

\par into the ranks of pauperism. Legislators who in 1833 voted

\par that the step they then took would lead to forced contributions,

\par Neither did those who in 1834 passed an Act regulating the
\par labour of women and children in certain factories, irnagine
\par that the system they were beginning would end in the ra
\par striction and inspection of labour in all kinds of producing

\par telegraphs by the State is made a reason for urging that the
\par State should buy and work the railways. Supplying children
\par with food for their minds by public agency is being followed
\par ill some cases by supplying food for their bodies; and after
\par the practice has been made gradually more general, we may
\par anticipate that the supply,now proposed to be made gratis in

\par All the many appliances for" stamping out" epidemic diseases

\par The extension of this policy, causing extension of corre..

\par right. " Surely you would not have this misery continue 1"
\par exclaims some one, if you hint a\'b7 demurrer to much that is

\par place or form into another place or form-often being increased
\par by the change. The exclarnation also implies the

\par of all kinds should be dealt with by the State. There does
\par not occur the inquiry whether there are at work other agencies
\par capable .of dealing with evils, and whether the evils in
\par question may not be among those which are best dealt with
\par THE COMING SLAVERY. 35
\par by these other agencies. And obviously, the more numerous
\par governmental interventions becolne, the more confirmed does
\par this habit of thought grow, and the more loud and perpetual
\par the demands for intervention.
\par Every extension of the regulative policy involves an addition
\par to the regulative agents-a further growth of officialism
\par and an increasing power of the orgnniza.tion form~d of
\par officials. Take a pair of scales with lnany shot in the one
\par and a few in the other. Lift shot after shot out of the loaded
\par scale and put it into the unloaded scale. Presently you will
\par produce a balance; and if you. go on, the position of the
\par scales will be reversed. Suppose the beam to be unequally
\par divided, and let the lightly loaded scale be at the end of a
\par very long arm; then the transfer of each shot, producing a
\par much greater effect, will far sooner brin~ about a change of
\par position. I use the figure to illustrate what results from
\par transferring one individual after another from the regulated
\par mass of the community to the regulating structures. The
\par transfer weakens the one and strengthens the other in a far
\par greater degree than is implied by the relative change of
\par numbers. A cOlnparatively small body of officials, coherent,
\par having common interests, and acting under central authority,
\par has an immense advantage over an incoherent public which
\par has no settled policy, and can be brought to act unitedly
\par only under strong provocation. lIenee an organization of
\par officials, once passing a, certain stage of growth, becomes
\par less and less resistible; as we see in the bureaucracies of
\par the Continent.
\par Not only does the power }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 resistance of the regulated

\par part itself, make the change of ratio still more rapid. In

\par One consequence is that men who rnight otherwise reprobate
\par further growth of officialism, are led to look on it with
\par tolerance, if not favourably, as offering possible careers for
\par those dependent on theln and those related to them. A.ny
\par one who relnembers the numbers of upper-class and middleclass
\par families anxious to place their children, will see that no
\par small encouragement to the spread. of legislative control is
\par now coming froln those who, but for the personal interests
\par thus arising, would be hostile to it.
\par This pressing desire for careers is enforced by the preference
\par for careers which are thought respectable. "Even
\par should his salary be Snlan, his occupation will be that of a
\par gentleman," thinks the father, who wants to get a Government-
\par clerkship for his son. And this relative dignity of
\par State-servants as cOlnpared 'with those occupied in business
\par increases as the administrative organization becomes a larger
\par and nlore powerful element in society, and tends more and
\par nlore to fix the standard of honour. The prevalent ambition
\par with a young Frenchman is to get som,e small official post
\par in his locality, to rise thence to a place in the local centre of
\par governrnent, and finally to reach some head-office in Paris.
\par And in Russia, where that universality Ot State-regulation
\par which characterizes the Inilitant type of society has been
\par carried furthest, 'w'e see this ambition pushed to its extreme.
\par Says Mr. Wallace, quoting a passage from a play :-" All
\par men, even shopkeepers and cubblers, aim at becoming officers,
\par and the man ,;vho has passed his whole life without official
\par rank seems to be not a human being." *
\par These various influences working from above downwards,
\par meet with an increasing response of expectations and solicitations
\par proceeding from below upwards. The hard-w'orked

\par faith to all builders of political air-castles, from Oxford

\par true prophets by many of us. "
\par And that the connexion of cause and effect here alleged is a
\par real one, we may see clearly enough in the present state of
\par Germany.
\par Being possessed of electoral power, as are now the mass
\par of those who are thus led to nurture sanguine anticipations
\par of benefits to be obtained by social reorganization, it results
\par that ,vhoever seeks their votes must at least refrain from exposing
\par their mistaken beliefs; even if he does not yield to
\par the temptation to express agreement with them. Every candidate
\par for Parliament is prompted to propose or support some
\par new piece of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 ad oaptandum }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 legislation. Nay, even the chiefs
\par of parties-these anxious to retain office and those to wrest it
\par from them-severally aim to get adherents by outbidding one
\par another. Each seeks popularity by promising more than his
\par opponent has promised, as we have lately seen. And then,

\par principle, because party-needs and regard for the next elec~
\par tion demand it. And thus a vicious policy is strengthened
\par even by those who see its viciousness.
\par Meanwhile there goes on out-of-doors an active propaganda
\par to which all these influences are ancillary. Communistic
\par theories, partially indorsed by one Act of Parliament
\par after another, and tacitly if not avowedly fa.voured by numerous
\par public men seeking supporters, are being advocated
\par more and more vociferously by popular leaders, and urged
\par on by organized societies. There is the movement for landnationalization
\par which, aiming at a system of land-tenure
\par equitable in the abstract, is, as all the world knows, pressed
\par by Mr. George and his friends with avowed disregard for
\par the just claims of existing owners, and as the basis of a
\par scheme going lllore than half-way to State-socialism. And
\par then there is the thorough-going Dernocratic Federation of
\par Mr. Hyndman and his adherents. We are told by them that
\par "the handful of marauders who now hold possession [of the
\par land] have and can have no right save brute force against the
\par tens of millions whom they wrong." They exclaim against
\par "the shareholders who have been allowed to lay hands
\par upon (!) our great railway communications." They condemn
\par "above all, the active capitalist class, the loan-mongers, the
\par farmers, the mine exploiters, the contractors, the middlemen,
\par the factory-lords-these, the modern slave drivers"
\par who exact "more and yet more surplus value out of the
\par wage-slaves whom they employ." And they think it " high
\par time" that trade should be "removed from the control of
\par individual greed." *
\par It remains to point out that the tendencies thus variously
\par displayed, are being strengthened by press advocacy, daily
\par more pronounced. Journalists, always chary of saying that
\par which is distasteful to their readers, are some of them going

\par ment which meets us one day. On another day, a town
\par which does not adopt the Free Libraries Act is sneered at
\par as being alarmed by a measure so moderately communistic.
\par And then, along with editorial assertions that this economic
\par evolution is coming and must be accepted, there is promi"
\par nence given to the contributions of its advocates. Meanwhile
\par those who regard the recent course of legislation as
\par disastrous, and see that its future course is likely to be still
\par more disastrous, are being reduced to silence by the belief
\par that it is useless to reason with people in a state of political

\par See, then, the many concurrent causes which threaten
\par continually to accelerate the transformation now going on
\par There is that spread of regulation caused by following prec,

\par policy is carried. There is that increasing need for administrative
\par compulsions and restraints, which results from the
\par unforeseen evils and shortcomings of preceding compulsions
\par and restraints. Moreover, every additional State-interference
\par strengthens. the tacit assumption that it is the duty of
\par the State to deal with all evils and secure all benefits. Increasing
\par power of a growing administrative organization is
\par accompanied by decreasing power of the rest of the society
\par to resist its further growth and control. The multiplication
\par of careers opened by a developing bureaucracy, tempts members
\par of the classes regulated by it to favour its extension, as
\par adding to the chances of safe and respectable places for their
\par relatives. The people at large, led to look on benefits received
\par through public agencies as gratis benefits, have their
\par hopes continually excited by the prospects of more. .A.
\par spreading education, furthering the diffusion of pleasing
\par errors rather than of stern truths, renders such hopes both

\par ministered to by candidates for public choice, to augment
\par their chances of success; and leading statesmen, in pursuit of
\par party ends, bid for popular favour by countenancing them.
\par Getting repeated justifications from new laws .harmonizing

\par thropists push their agitations with growing confidence and

\par daily strengthens it by giving it voice; while counter-opinion,
\par more and more discouraged, finds little utterance.
\par Thus influences of various kinds conspire to increase
\par corporate action and decrease individual action. And the
\par change is being on all sides aided by schemers, each of whom
\par thinks only of his pet plan and not at all of the general reorganization
\par which his plan, joined with others such, are working
\par out. It is said that the French Revolution devoured its
\par own children. Here, an analogous castastrophe seems not
\par unlikely. The numerous socialistic changes made by Act of
\par Parlianlent, joined with the numerous others presently to be
\par made, will by-and-by be all merged in State-socialismswallowed
\par in the vast wave w'hich they have little by little
\par raised.
\par "But why is this change described as 'the coming
\par slavery' ~" is a question which many will still ask. The
\par reply is simple. .All socialism involves slavery.
\par What is essential to the idea of a slave ~ We prinlarily
\par think of him as one who is o,vned by another. To be more
\par than nominal, however, the ownership IT1Ust be shown by
\par control of the slave's actiolls--a control "rhich is habitually
\par for the benefit of the controller. That ,vhich fundamentally
\par distinguishes the slave is that he labours under coercion to
\par satisfy another's desires. The relation admits of sundry
\par gradations. Remembering that originally the slave is a
\par prisoner whose life is at the nlercy of his captor, it suffices
\par here to note that there is a harsh form of slavery in which,
\par 42 THE MAN }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 VERSUS }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 THE STATE.
\par treated as an animal, he has to expend his entire effort for his
\par owner's advantage. Under a system less harsh, though
\par occupied chiefly in working for his owner, he is allowed a
\par short time in which to work for himself, and some ground
\par on which to grow extra food. A further amelioration gives
\par him power to sell the produce of his plot and keep the proceeds.
\par Then we come to the still 'more moderated form
\par which commonly arises where" having been a free man workc
\par ing 011 his own land, conquest turns him into what we distinguish
\par as a serf; and he has to give to his owner each year
\par a fixed amount of labour or produce, or both: retaining the
\par rest himself. Finally, in some cases, as in Russia before
\par serfdom was abolished, he is allowed to leave his owner's
\par estate and work or trade for himself elsewhere, under the
\par condition that he shall pay an annual sum. What is it
\par which, in these cases, leads us to qualify our conception of
\par the slavery as more or less severe ~ Evidently the greater
\par or smaller extent to which effort is compulsorily expended
\par for the benefit of another instead of for self-benefit. If all
\par the slave's labour is for his owner the slavery is heavy, and
\par if but little it is light. Take now a further step. Suppose
\par an owner dies, and his estate with its slaves comes into the
\par hands of trustees; or suppose the estate and everything on
\par it to be bought by a company; is the condition of the slave
\par any the better if the amount of his compulsory labour remains
\par the same ~ Suppose that for a company we substitute
\par the community; does it make any difference to the slave if
\par the time he has to work for others is as great, and the time
\par left for himself is as small, as before ~ The essential question
\par is-How much is he compelled to labour for other
\par benefit than his own, and how much can he labour for his
\par own benefit ~ The degree of his slavery varies according to
\par the ratio between that which he is forced to yield up and
\par that which he is allowed to retain; and it matters not
\par whether his master is a single person or a society. If, without
\par option, he has to labour for the society, and receives from
\par THE COMING SLAVERY. 43
\par the general stock such portion as the society awards him, he
\par becomes a slave to the society. Socialistic arrangements
\par necessitate an enslavelnent of this kind; and towards such
\par an enslavement many recent measures, and still more the
\par measures advocated, are carrying us. Let us observe,
\par first, their proximate effects, and then their ultimate effects.
\par The policy initiated by the Industrial Dwellings Acts admits
\par of development, and will develop. Where lllunicipal
\par bodies turn house-builders, they inevitably lower the values
\par of houses otherwise built, and check the supply }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Inore.
\par Every dictation respecting modes of building and conveniences
\par to be provided, diminishes the builder's profit, and
\par prompts him to use his capital where the profit is not thus
\par diminished. So, too, the owner, already finding that small
\par houses entail much labour and many losses-already subject
\par to troubles of inspection and interference, and to consequent
\par costs, and having his property daily rendered a more undesirable
\par investment, is prompted to sell; and as buyers
\par are for like reasons deterred, he has to sell at a loss. And
\par now these still-multipl,ying regulations, ending, it may be, as
\par Lord Grey proposes, in one requiring the owner to maintain
\par the salubrity of his houses by evicting dirty tenants, and
\par thus adding to his other responsibilities that of inspectoro\'a3
\par nuisances, nlust further prompt sales and further deter purchasers:
\par so necessitating\'b7 greater depreciation. What must
\par happen ~ The multiplication }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 houses, and especially small
\par houses, being increasing-ly checked, there must come an increasing
\par demand upon the local authority to\'b7make up for the
\par deficient supply. More and more the municipal or kindred
\par body will have to build houses, or to purchase houses
\par rendered unsaleable to private persons in the way shownhouses

\par gone so far as to nlake the local authority the chief owner of
\par houses, there will bea good precedent for publicly providing
\par houses for the rural population, as proposed in the Radical
\par programme,t and as urged by the Delllocratic Federation;

\par to the population." Manifestly, the tendency of that which
\par has been done, is being done, and is presently to be done, is
\par to approach the socialistic ideal in which the community is
\par sole house-proprietor.
\par Such, too, must be the effect of the daily-growing policy
\par on the tenure and utilization of the land. More numerous
\par public benefits, to be achieved by more numerous public
\par agencies, at the cost of augmented public burdens, must increasingly
\par deduct from the returns on land; until, as the

\par incidents of a kindred nature at home. Besides the facts that
\par under the old Poor Law the rates had in some parishes risen
\par to half the rental, and that in various places farms were lying
\par idle, there is the fact that in one case the rates had absorbed
\par the whole proceeds of the soil.
\par A.t Cholesbury, in Buckinghamshire, in 1832, the poor rate "suddenly
\par ceased in consequence of the impossibility to continue its
\par collection, the landlords have given up their rents, the farmers their
\par tenancies, and the clergyman his glebe and his tithes. The clergyman,
\par Mr. J'eston, states that in October~ 1832, the parish officers threw up
\par their books, and the poor assembled in a body before his door while
\par he was in bed, asking for advice and food. Partly from his own small
\par means, partly from the charity of neighbours, and partly by rates in
\par aid, imposed on the neighbouring parishes, they were for some time
\par supported. " *
\par And the Commissioners add that "the benevolent rector
\par recornmends that the whole of the land should be divided
\par among the able-bodied paupers:" hoping that after help
\par afforded for two years they might be able to maintain themselves.
\par These facts, giving colour to the prophecy made in
\par Parlianlent that continuance of the old Poor Law for another
\par thirty years would throw the land out of cultivation, clearly
\par show that increase of public burdens may end in forced
\par cultivation under public control.

\par that those possessed by strong hopes habitually dwell on the

\par Impressed with the miseries existing under our present social

\par propose that production should be carried on by "agricultural

\par not remembering that armies pre-suppose grades of officers,
\par by whom obedience would have to be insisted upon; since
\par otherwise neither order nor efficient work could. be ensured.
\par So that each would stand toward the governing agency in
\par the relation of slave to master.
\par " But the governing agency would be a master which he
\par and others nlade and kept constantly in check; and one
\par which therefore would not control him or others more than
\par was needful for the benefit of each and all."
\par To which reply the first rejoinder is that, even if so, each
\par member of the community as an individual would be a slave
\par to the community as a whole. Such a relation has habitually
\par existed in militant communities, even under quasi-popular
\par forIns of government. In ancient Greece the accepted principle
\par was that the citizen belonged neither to himself nor to
\par his :family, but belonged to his city-the city being with
\par the Greek equivalent to the conlmunity. And this doctrine,
\par proper to a state of constant warfare, is a doctrine which
\par socialism unawares re-introduces into a state intended to be
\par purely industrial. The services of each will belong to the
\par aggregate of all; and for these services, such returns will be
\par given as the authorities think proper. So that even if the
\par administration is of the beneficent kind intended to be secured,
\par slavery, however lnild, must be the outcome of the
\par arrangement.
\par A second rejoinder is that the administration will presently
\par become not of the intended kind, and that the slavery
\par will not be mild. The socialist speculation is vitiated by an
\par assumption like that \'b7which vitiates the speculations of the
\par "practical" politician. It is assumed that officialism will
\par work as it is intended to work, which it never does. The
\par machinery of Oommunisln, like existin,g social machinery,

\par has to be framed out }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 existing human nature; and the defects
\par of existing human nature will generate in the one the
\par same evils as in the other. The love of power, the selfishness,
\par the injustice, the untruthfulness, which often in comparatively
\par short times bring private organizations to disaster,
\par will inevitably, where their effects accumulate from generation
\par to generation, work evils far greater and less remediable;
\par since, vast and complex and possessed of all the resources,
\par the administrative organization once developed and consolidated,
\par must become irresistible. And if there needs proof
\par that the periodic exercise of electoral power would fail to
\par prevent this, it suffices to instance the French Government,
\par which, purely popular in origin, and subject at short intervals
\par to popular judgluent, nevertheless tramples on the freedom
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 citizens to an extent w\'b7hich the English delegates to the

\par The final result would be a revival of despotism. A disciplined
\par army of civil officials, like an army of military o:ffi~
\par cials, gives supreme power to its head-a power which has
\par often led to usurpation, as in luedireval Europe and still more
\par in Japan-nay, has thus so led atnong our neighbours, within
\par our own times. The recent confessions of M. de Maupas
\par have shown how readily a constitutional head, elected and

\par confederates, paralyze the representative body
\par and make himself autocrat. That those who rose to power

\par members of this same council urging that the State should
\par take possession of the railways, "with or without compensation,"
\par we lnay suspect that the heads of the ideal society
\par desired, would be but little deterred by considerations of
\par equity from pursuing whatever policy they thought needful:
\par a policy which would always be one identified with their
\par own supremacy. It would need but a war with an adjacent
\par society, or some internal discontent demanding forcible
\par suppression, to at once transform a socialistic administration
\par into a grinding tyranny like that of ancient Peru; under
\par which the. mass of the people, controlled by grades of officials,
\par and leading lives that were inspected out-of-doors and
\par in-doors, laboured for the support of the organization which
\par regulated them, and were left with but a bare subsistence for
\par themselves. And then would be completely revived, under
\par a different form, that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of status-that system of compulsory

\par " But we shall be on our guard against all that-we shall

\par FROM FREEDOM TO BONDAGE.
\par OF the many ways in which common-sense inferences
\par about social affairs are flatly contradicted by events (as
\par when measures taken to suppress a book cause increased circulation
\par of it, or as when attempts to prevent usurious rates
\par of interest make the terms harder for the borrower, or as
\par when there is greater difficulty in getting things at the places
\par of production than elsewhere) one of the most curious is the
\par way in which the more things improve, the louder become
\par the exclamations about their badness.
\par In days when the people were without any political
\par power, their subjection was rarely complained of; but after
\par free institutions had so far advanced in England that our
\par political arrangements were envied by Continental peoples,
\par the denunciations of aristocratic rule grew gradually
\par stronger, until there came a great widening of the franchise,
\par soon followed by complaints that things were going
\par wrong for want of still further widening. If we trace up
\par the treatment of women from the days of savagedom, when
\par they bore all the burdens and after the men had eaten received
\par such food as remained, up through the Middle Ages
\par when they served the men at their meals, to our own day
\par when throughout our social arrangements the claims of
\par women are always put first, we see that along with the worst
\par treatment there went the least apparent consciousness that
\par the treatment was bad; while now that they are better
\par 54
\par FROM FREEDOM TO BONDAGE. 55
\par treated than ever before, the proclaiming of their grievances
\par daily strengthens: the loudest outcries coming from
\par "the paradise of women," America. A century ago, when
\par scarcely a man could be found who was not occasionally intoxicated,
\par and when inability to take one or two bottles of
\par wine brought contempt, no agitation arose against the vice
\par of drunkenness; but now that, in the course of fifty years,
\par the voluntary efforts of temperance societies, joined with
\par more general causes, have produced comparative sobriety,
\par there are vociferous demands for laws to prevent the ruinous
\par effects of the liquor-traffic. Similarly again with education.
\par A few generations back, ability to read and write was practically
\par limited to the upper and middle classes, and the
\par suggestion that the rudiments of culture should be given
\par to laborers was never made, or, if made, ridiculed; but
\par when, in the days of our grandfathers, the Sunday-school
\par system, initiated by a few philanthropists, began to spread
\par and was followed by the establishment of day-schools, with
\par the result that among the masses those who could read and
\par write were no longer the exceptions, and the demand for
\par cheap literature rapidly increased, there began the cry that
\par the people were perishing for lack of knowledge, and that
\par the State must not simply educate them but must force education
\par upon them.
\par And so is it, too, with the general state of the population
\par in respect of food, clothing, shelter, and the appliances of
\par life. Leaving out of the comparison early barbaric states,
\par there has been a conspicuous progress from the time when
\par most rustics lived on barley bread, rye bread, and oatmeal,
\par down to our own time when the consumption of white
\par wheaten bread is universal; from the days when coarse
\par jackets reaching to the knees left the legs bare, down to the
\par present day when laboring people, like their employers, have

\par which has relieved the lower classes at the expense of the

\par Not that the evils to be remedied are small. Let no one

\par make light of the sufferings which most men have to bear.
\par The fates of the great majority have ever been, and doubtless
\par still are, so sad that it is painful to think of them. Unquestionably
\par the existing type of social organization is one which
\par none who care for their kind can contemplate with satisfaction;
\par and unquestionably men's activities accompanying this
\par type are far from being admirable. The strong divisions of
\par rank and the immense inequalities of means, are at variance
\par with that ideal of human relations on which the sympathetic
\par imagination likes to dwell; and the average conduct, urider
\par the pressure and excitement of social life as at present
\par carried on, is in sundry respects repulsive. Though the
\par many who revile competition strangely ignore the enormous
\par benefits resulting from it; though they forget that most of
\par the appliances and products distinguishing civilization from
\par savagery, and making possible the maintenance of a large
\par population on a small area, have been developed by the
\par struggle for existence; though they disregard the fact that
\par while every man, as producer, suffers from the underbidding
\par of competitors, yet, as the consumer, he is immensely advantaged
\par by the cheapening of all he has to buy; though they
\par persist in dwelling on the evils of competition and saying
\par nothing of its benefits; yet it is not to be denied that the
\par evils are great, and form a large set-off from the benefits.
\par The system under which we at present live fosters dishonesty
\par and lying. It prompts adulterations of countless kinds; it
\par is answerable for the cheap imitations which eventually in
\par many cases thrust the genuine articles out of the market;

\par Moreover, the extensive frauds, common throughout

\par The system of voluntary co-operation is that by which, in

\par Under a simple form we have it on every farm, where the
\par laborers, paid by the farmer himself and taking orders directly

\par overlookers; and under these, operatives of different grades.
\par In each of these cases there is an obvious working together,
\par or co-operation, of employer and employed, to obtain in the
\par one case a crop and in the other case a manufactured stock.
\par And then, at the same time, there is a far more extensive,
\par though unconscious, co-operation with other workers of all
\par grades throughout the society. For while these particular
\par employers and employed are severally occupied with their
\par special kinds of work, other employers and employed are
\par making other things needed for the carrying on of their
\par lives, as well as the lives of all others. This voluntary cooperation,
\par from its simplest to its most complex :forms, has
\par the common trait that those concerned work together by
\par consent. There is no one to force terms or to force-acceptance.
\par It is perfectly true that in many cases an employer
\par may give, or an }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 employe }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 may accept, with reluctance: circumstances,
\par he says, compel him. But what are the circumstancesY
\par In the one case there are goods ordered, or a contract
\par entered into, which he cannot supply or execute without
\par yielding; and in the other case he submits to a wage less
\par than he likes because otherwise he will have no money wherewith
\par to procure food and warmth. The general formula is
\par not "Do this, or I will make you;" but it is "Do this, or
\par leave your place and take the consequences."
\par On the other hand, compulsory co-operation is exemplified
\par by an army; not so much by our own army, the service
\par in which is under agreement for a specified period, but in a
\par Continental army, raised by conscription. Here, in time of
\par peace, the daily duties-cleaning, parade, drill, sentry-work,
\par and the rest-and in time of war the various actions of the
\par camp and the battle-field, are done under command, without
\par room for any exercise of choice. Up from the private soldier
\par through the non-commissioned officers and the half-dozen or
\par more grades of commissioned officers, the unversal law is
\par absolute obedience from the grade below to the grade above.
\par The sphere of individual will is such only as is allowed by
\par FROM FREEDOM rro BONDAGE. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 61
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 the will of the superior. Breaches of subordination are~ according
\par to their gravity, dealt with by deprivation of leave,
\par extra drill, imprisonment, flogging, and, in the last resort,
\par shooting. Instead of the understanding that there must be
\par obedience in respect of specified duties under pain of dismissal,
\par the understanding now is: "Obey in everything ordered,
\par under penalty of inflicted suffering and perhaps
\par death. "
\par This form of co-operation, still exemplified in an army,
\par has in days gone by been the form of co-operation throughout
\par the civil population. Everywhere, and at all times,
\par chronic war generates a militant type of structure, not in
\par the body of soldiers only, but throughout the community at
\par large. Practically, while the conflict between societies is
\par actively going on, and fighting is regarded as the only manly
\par occupation, the society is the quiescent army and the army
\par the mobilized society: that part which does not take part in
\par battle, composed of slaves, serfs, women, &c., constituting the
\par commissariat. Naturally, therefore, throughout the mass of
\par inferior individuals constituting the commissariat, there is
\par maintained a system of discipline identical in nature if less
\par elaborate. The fighting body being, under such conditions,
\par the ruling body, and the rest of the community being incapable
\par of resistance, those who control the fighting body
\par will, of course, impose their control upon the non-fighting
\par body; and the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of coercion will be applied to it with
\par such modifications only as the different circumstances involve.
\par Prisoners of war become slaves. Those who were
\par free cultivators before the conquest of their country, become
\par serfs attached to the soil. Petty chiefs become subject to
\par superior chiefs; these smaller lords become vassals to overlords;
\par and so on up to the highest: the social ranks and
\par powers being of like essential nature with the ranks and
\par powers throughout the military organization. And while
\par for the slaves compulsory co-operation is the unqualified
\par system, a co-operation which is in part compulsory is the

\par system that pervades all grades above. Each man's oath of
\par fealty to his suzerain takes the :form, "I am your man."
\par Throughout Europe, and especially in our own country,
\par this system of compulsory co-operation gradually relaxed in
\par rigor, while th~ system of voluntary co-operation step by
\par step replaced it. As fast as war ceased to be the business
\par of life, the social structure produced by war, and appropriate
\par to it, slowly became qualified by the social structure
\par produced by industrial life, and appropriate to it. In proportion
\par as a decreasing part of the community was devoted
\par to offensive and defensive activities, an increasing part became
\par devoted to production and distribution. Growing
\par more numerous, more powerful, and taking refuge in towns
\par where it was less under the power of the militant class, this
\par industrial population carried on its life under the system
\par of voluntary co-operation. Though municipal governments
\par and guild-regulations, partially pervaded by ideas and
\par usages derived from the militant type of society, were in
\par some degree coercive; yet production and distribution were
\par in the main carried on under agreement, alike between
\par buyers and sellers, and between masters and workmen. As
\par fast as these social relations and forms of activity became
\par dominant in urban populations, they influenced the whole
\par community: compulsory co-operation lapsed more and more,
\par through money-commutation for services, military and civil;
\par while divisions of rank became less rigid and class-power
\par diminished, until at length, restraints exercised by incorporated
\par trades having fallen into desuetude, as well as the
\par rule of rank over rank, voluntary co-operation became the
\par universal principle. Purchase and sale became the law for
\par all kinds of services as well as for all kinds of commodities.

\par The restlessness generated by pressure against the conditions
\par Qf existence perpetually prompts the desire to try
\par a new position. Everyone knows how long-continued rest
\par FROM FREEDOM TO BONDAGE. 63
\par in one attitude becomes wearisom.e; everyone has found how
\par even the' best easy chair, at first rejoiced in, becomes after
\par many hours intolerable; and change to a hard seat, previously
\par occupied and rejected, seems for a time to be a great
\par relief. It is the same with incorporated humanity. Having
\par by long struggles emancipated itself from the hard discipline
\par of the ancient }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime" }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 and having discovered that the

\par is not without stresses and pains., its impatience with these
\par prompts the wish to try another system: which other system
\par is, in principle if not in appearance, the same as that which
\par during past generations was escaped from with much
\par rejoicing.
\par For as fast as the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of contract is discarded, the

\par co-operation is abandoned, compulsory co-operation
\par must be substituted. Some kind of organization labor must
\par have; and if it is not that which arises by agreement under
\par free competition, it must be that which is imposed by
\par authority. Unlike in appearance and names as it may be to
\par the old order of slaves and serfs, working under masters,
\par who were coerced by barons who were themselves vassals of

\par workers under, foremen of small groups, overlooked by superintendents,
\par who are subject to higher local managers, who
\par are controlled by superiors of districts, themselves under a
\par central government, must be essentially the same in principle.
\par In the one case, as in the other, there must be established
\par grades, and enforced subordination of each grade to
\par the grades above. This is a truth which the communist or
\par the socialist does not dwell upon.. Angry with the existing
\par system under which each of us takes care of himself while all
\par of us see that each has fair play, he thinks how much better
\par it would be for all of us to take care of each of us; and he

\par the embodied all must get the means-the necessaries of
\par life. What it gives to each must be taken from the accumulated
\par contributions; and it must therefore require from each
\par his proportion-must tell him how much he has to give to
\par the general stock in the shape of production, that he may
\par have so much in the shape of sustentation. Hence, before
\par he can be provided for, he must put himself under orders,
\par and obey those who say what he shall do, and at what hours,
\par and where; and who give him his share of food, clothing,
\par and shelter. If competition is excluded, and with it buying
\par and selling, there can be no voluntary exchange of so much
\par labor for 'so much produce; but there must be apportionment
\par of the one to the other by appointed officers. This apportionment
\par must be enforced. Without alternative the work
\par must be done, and without alternative the benefit, whatever
\par it may be, must be accepted. For the worker may not leave
\par his place at will and offer himself elsewhere. Under such
\par a system he cannot be accepted elsewhere, save by order of
\par the authorities. And it is manifest that a standing order
\par would forbid employment in one place of an insubordinate
\par member from another place: the system could not be worked
\par if the workers were severally allowed to go or come as they
\par pleased. With corporals and sergeants under them, the
\par captains of industry must carry out the orders of their
\par colonels, and these of their generals, up to the council of the
\par commander-in-chief; and obedience must be required
\par throughout the industrial army as throughout a fighting
\par army. "Do your prescribed duties, and take your apportioned
\par rations," must be the rule of the one as of the other.
\par ,'Well, be it so," replies the socia-list. "The workers
\par will appoint their own officers, and these will always be subject
\par to criticisms of the mass they regulate. Being thus in
\par fear of public opinion, they will be sure to act judiciously

\par answer pointed to by instances above given, and warranted

\par apparatus everywhere controlling all kinds of production

\par existing voluntary co-operation, with its free contracts and
\par its competition, production and distribution need no official
\par oversight. Demand and supply, and the desire of each man
\par to gain a living by supplying the needs of his fellows, spontaneously

\par this is forthwith crushed by an overwhelming number of

\par OnlX when the misconduct is extreme does the
\par resistance of shareholders suffice to displace the ruling body.
\par Nor is it otherwise with societies formed of workingmen and
\par having the interests of labor especially at heart; the tradesunions.
\par In these, too, the regulative agency becomes allpowerful.
\par Their members, even when they dissent from the
\par policy pursued, habitually yield to the authorities they have
\par set up. As they cannot seced~ without making enemies of
\par their fellow workmen, and often losing all chance of employment,
\par they succumb. Weare shown, too, by the late congress,
\par that already, in the general organization of tradesunions
\par so recently formed, there are complaints of "wirepullers"
\par and "bosses" and "permanent officials." If, then,
\par this supremacy of the regulators is seen in bodies of quite

\par what will the supremacy of'the regulators become
\par in long-established bodies, in bodies which have become vast
\par and highly-organized; and in bodies which, instead of controlling
\par only a small part of the unit's life, control the whole
\par of his life?
\par Again there will come the rejoinder, "We shall guard
\par against all that. Everybody will be educated;\'b7 and all, with
\par their eyes constantly open to the abuse of power, will be
\par quick to prevent it.' , The worth of these expectations
\par would be small, even could we not identify the causeswhich
\par FROM FREEDOM TO BONDAGE. 73
\par will bring disappointment; for in human affairs the most
\par promising schemes go wrong in ways which no one anticipated.
\par But in this case the going wrong will be necessitated
\par by causes which are conspicuous. The working of institutions
\par is determined by men's characters; and the existing defects
\par in their characters will inevitably bring about the
\par r~sults Qbov~ indicated. There is no adequate endowment
\par of those sentiments required to prevent the growth of a
\par despotic bureaucracy.
\par Were it needful to dwell on indirect evidence, much
\par might be made of that furnished by the behavior of the so..
\par called Liberal party; a party which, relinquIshing the original
\par conception of a leader as a mouthpiece for a known
\par and accepted policy, thinks itself bound to accept a policy
\par which its leader springs upon it without consent or warning;
\par a party so utterly without the feeling and idea implied
\par by Liberalism, as not to resent this trampling on the right
\par of private judgment which constitutes the root of Liberalism;
\par nay, a party which vilifies as renegade Liberals, those
\par of its members who refuse to surrender their independence!
\par But without occupying space with indirect proofs that the
\par mass of men have not the natures required to check the de..
\par velopment of tyrannical officialism, it will suffice to contem..
\par plate the direct proofs furnished by those classes among
\par whom the socialistic idea most predominates, and who think
\par themselves most interested in propagating it; the operative
\par classes. These would constitute the great body of the social..

\par Instead of the selfishness of the employing classes and

\par rules which hinder ascent from inferior classes of workers
\par to superior classes ~ One does not see in such regulations
\par any of that altruism by which socialism is to be pervaded.
\par Contrariwise, one sees a pursuit of private interests no less
\par keen than among traders. Hence, unless we suppose that
\par men's natures 'will be suddenly exalted, we must conclude
\par that the pursuit of private interests will sway the doings of
\par all the component classes in a socialistic society.
\par With passive disregard of others' claims goes active encroachment
\par on them. "Be one of us or we will cut off your
\par means of living," is the usual threat of each trades-union to
\par outsiders of the same trade. While their members insist on
\par their own freedom to combine and fix the rates at which they
\par will work (as they are perfectly justified in doing), the freedom
\par of those who disagree with them is not only denied but
\par the assertion of it is treated as a crime. Individuals who
\par maintain their rights to make their own contracts are vilified
\par as "blacklegs" and "traitors," and meet with violence which
\par would be merciless were there no legal penalties and no
\par police. Along with this trampling on the liberties of men of
\par their own class, there goes peremptory dictation to the employing
\par class: not prescribed terms and working arrangements
\par only shall be conformed to, but none save those
\par belonging to their body shall be employed; nay, in some
\par cases, there shall be a strike if the employer carries on transactions
\par with trading bodies that give work to non-union men.
\par Here, then, we are variously shown by trades-unions, or at
\par any rate by the newer trades-unions, a determination to impose
\par their regulations without regard to the rights of those
\par who are to be coerced. So complete is the inversion of ideas
\par and sentiments that maintenance of these rights is regarded
\par as vicious and trespass upon them as virtuous.:)(:
\par * Marvellous are the conclusions men reach when once they desert the
\par simple principle that each man should be allowed to pursue the objects
\par of life, restrained only by the limits which the similar pursuits of their
\par objects by other men impose. A generation ago we heard loud asserFROM
\par FREEDOM TO BONDAGE. 75
\par Along with. this aggressiveness in one direction there goes
\par submissiveness in another direction. The coercion of outsiders
\par by unionists is paralleled. only by their subjection to
\par their leaders. That they may conquer in the struggle they
\par surrender their individual liberties and in\'a2lividual judgments,
\par and show no resentment, however dictatorial may

\par their work or return to it as their authorities order them.
\par Nor do they resist when taxed all round to support strikers
\par whose acts they mayor may not approve, but instead, illtreat

\par The traits thus shown must be operative in any new
\par social organization, and the question to be asked is, What will
\par result from their operation when they are relieved from all
\par restraints YAt present the separate bodies of men displaying
\par them are in the midst of a society partially passive, partially
\par antagonistic; are subject to the criticisms and reprobations
\par of an independent press; and are under the control of law,

\par parts of the community, governed by their separate sets
\par of regulators, they constitute the whole community, govtiona
\par of "the right to labor," that is, the right to have labor provided;
\par and there are still not a few who think the community bound
\par to find work for each person. Compare this with the doctrine current
\par in France at the time when the monarchical power culminated; namely,
\par that "the right of working is a royal right which the prince can sell
\par and the subjects must buy~" This contrast is startling enough; but
\par a contrast still more startling is being provided for us. We now see a

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 A fundamental error pervading the thinking of nearly
\par all parties, political and social, is that evils admit of immediate
\par and radical remedies. "If you will but do this, the
\par mischief will be prevented." l: 'Adopt my plan, and the
\par suffering will disappear." "The corruption will unquestionably
\par be cured by enforcing this measure." Everywhere
\par one meets with b~li~fg, expr~ssed or implied, of these kind~t
\par They are all ill-founded. It is possible to remove causes
\par which intensify the evils; it is possible to change the evils
\par from one form into another; and it is possible, and very
\par common, to exacerbate the evils hy theefIorts made to
\par prevent them; but anything like immediate cure is impossible.
\par In the course of thousands of years mankind have,
\par by multiplication, been forced out of that original savage
\par state in which small numbers supported themselves on wild
\par food, into the civilized state in which the food required for
\par supporting great numbers can be got only by continuous
\par labor. The nature required for this last mode of life is
\par widely different from the nature required for the first; and
\par long-continued pains have to be passed through in re-molding
\par the one into the other. Misery has necessarily to be
\par borne by a constitution out of harmony with its conditions;
\par and a constitution inherited from primitive men is out of
\par harmony with the\'b7 conditions imposed on existing men.
\par Hence it is impossible to establish forthwith a satisfactory
\par social state. No such nature as that which has filled Europe
\par with millions of armed men, here eager for conquest and
\par there for revenge; no such nature as that which prompts
\par the nations called Christian to vie with one another in filibustering
\par expeditions all over the world, regardless of the
\par claims of aborigines, while their tens of thousands of priests
\par of the religion of love look on approvingly; no such nature
\par as that which, in dealing with weaker races, goes beyond
\par the primitive rule of life for life, and for one life. takes
\par many lives; no such nature, I say, can, by any device, be
\par framed into a harmonious community. The root of all wellordered

\par once insists on personal freedom and is solicitous for the
\par like freedom of others; and there at present exists but a
\par very inadequate amount of this sentiment.
\par Hence the need for further long continuance of a social
\par discipline which requires each man to carryon his activities
\par with due regard to the like claims of others to carryon
\par their activities; and which, while it insists that he shall
\par have all the benefits his conduct naturally brings, insists
\par also that he shall not saddle on others the evils that his
\par conduct naturally brings, unless they freely undertake to
\par bear them. And hence the belief that endeavors to elude
\par this discipline will not only fail, but will bring worse evils
\par than those to be escaped.
\par It is not, then, chiefly in the interests of the employing
\par classes that socialism is to be resisted, but much more in
\par the interests of the employed classes. In one way or other
\par production must be regulated; and the regulators, in the
\par nature of things, must always he a small class as compared
\par with the actual producers. Under voluntary co-operation
\par as at present carried on, the regulators, pursuing their personal
\par interests, take as large a share of the produce as they
\par can get; but, as we are daily shown by trades-union successes,
\par are restrained in the selfish pursuit of their ends.
\par Under that compulsory co-operation which socialism would
\par necessitate, the regulators, pursuing their personal interests
\par with no less selfishness, could not be met by the combined
\par resistance of free workers; and their power, unchecked as
\par now by refusals to work save on prescribed. terms, would
\par grow and ramify and consolidate till it became irresistible.
\par The ultimate result, as I have before pointed out, must be
\par a society like that of ancient Peru, dreadful to contemplate,
\par in which the mass of the people, elaborately regimented in
\par groups of ten, fifty, one hundred, five hundred, and one
\par thousand, ruled by officers of corresponding grades, and tied
\par to their districts, were superintended in their private lives
\par as well as in their industries, and toiled hopelessly for the
\par support of the governmental organization.
\par THE SINS OF LEGISLATORS.
\par BE it or be it not true that Man is shapen in iniquity and
\par conceived in sin, it is unquestionably true that Government
\par is begotten of aggression and by aggression. In slnall unde..
\par veloped societies where for ages complete peace has continued,
\par there exists nothing like what we call Government:
\par no coercive a.gency, but mere honorary headship, if any headship
\par at all. In these exceptional communities, unaggressive
\par and from special causes unaggressed upon, there is so little
\par deviation from the virtues of truthfulness, honesty, justice,
\par and generosity, that nothing beyond an occasional expression
\par of public opinion by informally-assembled elders is needful.*
\par Oonversely, we find proofs that, at first recognized but

\par is permanently established by continuity of war; and grows
\par strong where successful war ends in subjection of neighbouring
\par tribes. And thence onwards, examples furnished by
\par all races put beyond doubt the truth, that the coercive power
\par of the chief, developing into king,and king of kings (a

\par lIe is not allowed to excuse himself on the ground
\par that he did not intend harm but hoped for good. The plea
\par that he simply made a luistake in his diagnosis is not entertained.
\par He is told that he had no right to risk disastrous
\par consequences by meddling in a matter concerning which his
\par knowledge was so inadequate. The fact that he was ignorant
\par how great was his ignorance is not accepted in bar or judgment.
\par It is tacitly assumed that the experience COlnmon to
\par all should have taught him that even the skilled, and much
\par more the unskilled, make mistakes in the identification of
\par disorders and in the appropriate treatment; and that having
\par disregarded the warning derivable from COlumon experience,
\par he was answerable for the consequences.
\par We measure the responsibilities of legislators for Inischiefs
\par they may do, in a much 1110re lenient fashion: In most
\par cases, so far from thinking of them as deserving punishment
\par for causing disasters by laws ignorantly enacted, we scarcely
\par think of them as deserving reprobation. It is held that
\par common experience should have taught the druggist's assistant,
\par untrained as he is, not to interfere; but it is not held
\par that common experience should have taught the legislator
\par not to interfere till he has trained hilnself. Though multitudinous
\par facts are before him in the recorded legislation of
\par our own country and of other countries, which should impress
\par on him the immense evils caused by wrong treatment, he is
\par not condemned for disregarding- these warnings against rash
\par meddling. Contrariwise, it is thought meritorious in him
\par when-perhaps lately from college, perhaps fresh from keeping
\par a pack of hounds which made him popular in his county,
\par perhaps emerging from a provincial town where he acquired
\par a fortune, perhaps rising from the bar at which he has gained
\par a name as an advocate-he enters Parliament; and forthwith,

\par And yet the mischiefs wrought by uninstructed lawmaking,

\par to all who do but glance over its history. The reader must
\par pardon me while I recall a few familiar instances. Oentury

\par by magisterial order "the reasonable gains" of victuallers.*
\par Of like spirit and followed by allied mischiefs have been the
\par many endeavours to :fix wages, which began with the Statute
\par of Labourers under Edward III., and ceased only sixty years
\par ago; when, having long galvanized in Spital:fields a decaying
\par industry, and fostered there a miserable population, Lords

\par Here I imagine an impatient interruption. " We know all
\par that; the story is stale. The m.ischiefs of interfering with
\par trade have been dinned in our ears till we are weary; and no
\par one needs to be taught the lesson afresh." :My first reply is
\par that by the great majority the lesson was never properly
\par learnt at all, and that many of those who did learn it have
\par forgotten it. For just the same pleas which of old were put
\par in for these dictations, are again put in. In the statute 35 of

\par (but was soon repealed because it raised the price), it was
\par complained that people "coming to the fair ... do bargain
\par for herring, and every of them, by malice and envy, increase
\par upon other, and, if one proffer forty shilling, another will
\par proffer ten shillings more, and the third sixty shillings, and

\par "the higgling of the market," here condemned and ascribed
\par "to malice and envy," is being again condemned. The evils
\par of competition have all along been the stock cry of the
\par Socialists; and the council of the Democratic Federation
\par denounces the carrying on of exchange under "the control of
\par individual and greed profit." My second reply is that interferences
\par with the law of supply and den1and, which a generation
\par ago were admitted to be habitually mischievous, are now
\par being daily made by Acts of Parliament ill new fields; and

\par increasing the evils to be cured and producing fresh ones, as
\par of old they did in fields no longer intruded upon.
\par Returning from this parenthesis, I go on to explain that
\par the above Acts are named to remind the reader that uninstructed
\par legislators have in past tiInes continually increased
\par human suffering in their endeavours to mitigate it; and I
\par have }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 no"T }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 to add that if these evils, shown to be legislatively
\par intensified or produced, be multiplied by ten or more, a conception
\par will be formed of the aggregate evils caused by lawmaking
\par un9;uided by social science. In a paper read to the
\par Statistical Society in May, 18'73, Mr. Janson, vice-president
\par of the I~aw Society, stated that from the Statute of Merton
\par (20 Henry III.) to the end of 18'72, there had been passed
\par 18,110 public Acts; of which he estiruated that four-fifths
\par had been wholly or partially repealed. He also stated that
\par the number of public Acts repealed wholly or in part, or
\par amended, during the three years 18'70-'71-'72 had been 3,532,
\par of which 2,'759 had been totally repealed. To see whether
\par this state of repeal has continued, I have referred to the
\par annually-issued volumes of "The Public General Statutes"
\par for the last three sessions. Saying nothing of the numerous
\par alnended Acts, the result is that in the last three sessions
\par there have been totally repealed, separately or in groups,
\par 650 Acts, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 belonging to the present reign, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 besides nlany of preceding
\par reigns. This, of course, is greatly above the average
\par rate; for there has of late been an active purgation of the
\par statute-book. But making every allowance, we must infer
\par that within our own tiJnes, repeals have mounted some distance
\par into the thousands. Doubtless a number of them have
\par been of laws that were obsolete; others have been demanded
\par by changes of circumstances (though seeing how many of
\par them are of quite recent Acts, this has not been a large
\par cause); others sirnply because they were inoperative; and
\par others have been consequent on the consolidations of numer\'b7
\par ous Acts into single Acts. But unquestionably in multi~
\par tudinous cases, repeals came because the Acts had proved
\par THE SINS OF LEGISLATORS. 87
\par InJurIOUS. We talk glibly of such changes-we think of can..
\par celled legislation with indifference. We forget that before
\par laws are abolished they have generally been inflicting evils
\par more or less serious; some for a few years, SOlne for tens of
\par years, some for centuries. Ohange your vague idea of a bad
\par law into a definite idea of it as an agency operating on people's
\par lives, and you see that it means so much of pain, so much of
\par illness, so much of mortality. A. vicious form of legal procedure,
\par for example, either enacted or tolerated, entails on
\par suitors, costs, or delays, or defeats. What do these imply 1
\par Loss of Inoney, often ill-spared; great and prolonged anxiety;
\par frequently consequent bad health; unhappiness of fanlily
\par and dependents; children stinted in food and clothing-all
\par of theln miseries which bring after them multiplied remoter
\par miseries. Add to which the far more nunlerous cases of
\par those who, lacking the Ineans or the courage to enter on lawsuits,
\par and therefore submitting to frauds, are impoverished;
\par and have similarly to bear the pains of body and mind which
\par ensue. Even to say that a law has been simply a hindrance,
\par is to say that it has caused needless loss of time, extra trouble,
\par and additional worry; and among over-burdened people extra
\par trouble and worry imply, here and there, physical and mental
\par prostrations, with their entailed direct and indirect sufferings.
\par Seeing, then, that bad legislation means injury to men's
\par lives, judge ,vhat must be the total alnount of mental distress,
\par physical pain, and raised mortality, which these thousands of
\par repealed A.cts of Parliament represent! Fully to bring home
\par the truth that law-making unguided by adequate knowledge
\par brings enormous evils, let me take an instance which a question
\par of the day recalls.
\par Already I have hinted that interferences with the connexion
\par between supply and demand, given up in certain fieldtt
\par after imrnense mischiefs had been done during many centuries,
\par are no,v taking place in other fields. This connexion is supposed

\par evils of disregarding it: so feeble is men's belief in it. There
\par appears no suspicion that in cases where it seems to fail,
\par natural causation has been traversed by artificial hindrances.
\par And yet in the case to which I now refer-that of the supply
\par of houses for the poor-it needs but to ask what laws have
\par been doing for a long time past, to see that the terrible evils
\par complained of are mostly law-made.
\par A generation ago discussion ,vas taking place concerning
\par the inadequacy and badness of industrial dwellings, and I had
\par occasion to deal with the question. Here is a passage then
\par written:-
\par "An architect. and surveyor describes it [the Building Act] as having
\par worked after the following manner. In those districts of London
\par consisting of inferior houses built in that unsubstantial fashion which
\par the New Building Act was to mend, there obtains an average rent,
\par sufficiently remunerative to landlords whose houses were run up economically
\par before the New Building Act passed. This existing average
\par rent fixes the rent that must be charged in these districts for new
\par houses of the same accommodation-that is the same number of rooms,
\par for the people they are built for do not appreciate the extra safety of
\par living within walls strengthened with hoop-iron bond. Now it turns
\par out upon trial, that houses built in accordance with the present
\par regulations, and let at this established rate, bring in nothing like a
\par reasonable return. Builders have consequently confined themselves to
\par erecting houses in better districts (where the possibility of a profitable
\par competition with pre-existing houses shows that those pre-existing
\par houses were tolerably substantial), and have ceased to erect dwellings
\par for the masses, except in the suburbs where no pressing sanitary evils
\par exist. Meanwhile, in the inferior districts above described, has resulted
\par an increase of overcrowding-half-a-dozen families in a house, a score
\par lodgerg to a room. Nay, more than this has resulted. That state of
\par miserable dilapidation into which these abodes of the poor are allowed
\par to fall, is due to the absence of competition from new houses. Landlords
\par do not find their tenants tempted away by the offer of better
\par accommodation. Repairs, being unnecessary for securing the largest
\par amount of profit, are not made. . . " In fact for a large percentage
\par of the very horrors which our sanitary agitators are trying to cure by
\par law, we have to thank previous agitators of the same school 1}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 "-Social

\par These were not the only law-made causes of such evils. As

\par recognized :-

\par " Lord Kinnaird recommends in your paper of yesterday the construction

\par " The third induces the builder to erect the poor man's house of
\par timber unfit for building purposes, the duty on the good material (Baltic)
\par being fifteen times lI'.ore than the duty on the bad or injurious article
\par (Canadian). The Government, even, exclude the latter from all their

\par " The fourth would have considerable influence upon the present
\par miserable state of the dwellings of the poor. Small freeholds might
\par then be transferred as easily as leaseholds. The effect of building
\par leases has been a direct inducement to bad building."
\par To guard against mis-statements or over-statements, I
\par have taken the precaution to consult a large East-end builder
\par and contractor of forty years' experience, Mr. C. Forrest,
\par Museum Works, 11, Victoria Park Square, Bethnal Green,
\par who, being chuchwarden, member of the vestry, and of the
\par board of guardians, adds extensive knowledge of local public
\par affairs to his extensive knowledge of the building business.
\par Mr. Forrest, who authorizes me to give his name, verifies the
\par foregoing statements, with the exception of one which he
\par strengthens. He says that " Architect" understates the evil
\par entailed by the definition of "a fourth-rate house;" since the
\par dimensions are much less than those he gives (perhaps\'b7 in
\par conformity with the provisions of a more recent Building
\par Act). Mr. Forrest has done more than this. Besides illustrating
\par the bad effects of great increase in ground-rents (in
\par sixty years from \'a31 to \'a38 }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 lOs. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 for a fourth-rate house)
\par which, joined with other causes, had obliged him to abandon
\par plans for industrial dwellings he had intended to buildbesides
\par agreeing with " Architect" that this evil has been
\par greatly increased by the difficulties of land transfer due to
\par the law-established system of trusts and entails; he pointed
\par out that a further penalty on the building of small houses
\par is inflicted by additions to local burdens (" prohibitory imposts"
\par he called them): one of the instances he named
\par being that to the cost of each new house has to be added the
\par cost of pavement, roadway, and sewerage, which is charged
\par according to length of frontage, and which, consequently,
\par THE SINS OF LEGISLATORS. 91
\par bears a far larger ratio to the value of a small house than to
\par the value of a large one.
\par From these law-produced mischiefs, which were great a
\par generation ago, and have since been increasing, let us pass to
\par more recent law-produced mischiefs. The misery, the disease,

\par * More recently, Glasgow has furnished a gigantic illustration of the
\par disasters which result from the socialistic meddlings of municipal bodies.
\par The particulars may be found in proceedings of the Glasgow Town Council,
\par reported in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Glasgow Herald }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 for September 11, 1891. In the course of
\par the debate it was said that the Glasgow Improvement Trust had for years
\par been pursuing a "course of blundering," and had landed the corporation
\par "in a quagmire." Out of some \'a32,000,000 taken from the ratepayers to
\par buy and clear 88 acres of bad house property, \'a31,000,000 had been got back
\par by sale of cleared lands. But the property remaining in the hands of the
\par Corporation, mostly vacant land, has, by successive valuations in 1880,
\par 1884, and 1891, been shown to have gradually depreciated to the extent of
\par \'a3320,OOO-an admitted depreciation, believed to be far less than the actual
\par depreciation. Moreover, model-blocks built by the Improvement Trust,
\par have proved to be not only financial failures, but also failures philanthropically
\par considered. One which cost \'a310,000, and in the first year yielded
\par 5 per cent., brought in the second year 4 per cent., and in the third 2! per
\par cent. Another which cost \'a311,000 yields only 3 per cent. And, as is thus
\par Implied, these dwellings, instead of being in demand, have a decreasing
\par number of tenants-a decreasing number, too, notwithstanding the fact
\par that the clearing of so large an area of low-class dwellings has increased
\par the pressure of the working population, made the over-crowding greater
\par in other parts of the city, and intensified the sanitary evils which were to

\par ing is strangled; * and we may reasonably suppose that among
\par the Guinea people, anyone audacious enough to call in
\par question the power of the fetish would be prolnptly sacrificed.
\par In days when Governmental authority was enforced by
\par strong measures, there was a kindred danger in saying anything
\par disrespectful of the political fetish. Nowadays, however,
\par the worst punishment to be looked for by one who
\par questions its omnipotence, is that he will be reviled as a
\par reactionary who talks }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 lai88ezfaire. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 That any facts he may
\par bring forward will appreciably decrease the established faith
\par is not to be expected; for we are daily shown that this faith
\par is proof against all adverse evidence. Let us contemplate a
\par small part of that vast mass of it which passes unheeded.
\par "A Government-office is like an inverted filter; you send
\par in accounts clear and they come out muddy." Such was the
\par be mitigated. Commenting on the results, as they had become manifest
\par at the close of 1888, Mr. Honeyman, President of the Social Economy Section
\par of the Glasgow Philosophical Soeiety, said that the model-building
\par put up by the Improvement Trust, was one" which no sane builder would
\par dream of imitating, because it would not pay," and that they had " put
\par anything like fair competition entirely out of the question:" "driving the
\par ordinary builder from the field." He also pointed out that the building
\par regulations and restrictions imposed by the Improvement Trust, tended" to
\par keep the land belonging to the Corporation vacant, and hinder the erection
\par of dwellings of the humblest class." In like manner, at a meeting of the
\par Kyrle Society, the Lord Provost of Glasgow pointed out that when, with
\par philanthropic motives, they built houses for the working-people at prices
\par which would not pay the ordinary builder, then" immediately the whole of
\par those builders who had hitherto supplied the wants of the working classes
\par would stop, and philanthropy would require to take the whole burden of
\par the provision on itself."
\par To achieve all these failures and produce all these evils, many thou\'b7-\'b7
\par sands of hard-working ratepayers, who have difficulty in making both ends
\par meet, have been taxed and pinched and distressed. See, then, the enormous
\par evils that follow in the train of the baseless belief in the unlimited
\par power of a majority-the miserable superstition that a body elected by the
\par greater number of citizens has the right to take from citizens at large any

\par of the detailed census of 1881, more than two years after the
\par information was collected. If we seek explanations of such
\par delays, we find one origin to be a scarcely credible confusion.
\par In the case of the census returns, the Registrar-General tells

\par And then, as Mr. Rathbone, M.P., points out,* these many

\par their respective governing bodies with authorities running

\par such evidence leave unabated the confidence with which sanitary
\par inspection is invoked-invoked, indeed, more than ever;
\par as is shown in the recent suggestion that all public schools
\par should be under the supervision of health-officers. Nay, even
\par when the State has manifestly caused the mischief cOlnplained
\par of, faith in its beneficent agency is not at all diminished; as
\par we see in the fact that, having a generation ago authorized,
\par or rather required, towns to establish drainage systems which
\par delivered sewage into the rivers, and having thus polluted
\par the sources of water-supply, an outcry was raised against the
\par water-companies for the impurities of their water-an outcry
\par which continued after these towns had been compelled, at
\par vast extra cost, to revolutionize their drainage systems. A.nd
\par now, as the only relnedy, there follows the demand that the
\par State, by its local proxies, shall undertake the whole business.
\par The State's misdoings become, at; in the case of industrial
\par dwellings, reasons for praying it to do more!
\par This worship of the legislature is, in one respect, indeed,
\par less excusable than the fetish-worship to which I have tacitly

\par silent-does not confess its inability. But the civilized man
\par persists in ascribing to this idol nlade with his own hands,
\par powers which in one way or other it confesses it has not got.
\par I do not mean merely that the debates daily tell us of legislative

\par do I mean Inerely that the thousands ofActs of Parliament

\par ways. We see it all through human history, from the warpaint
\par with which the savage frightens his adversary, down

\par kindred change of feeling comes over constituencies when,

\par by one or other party, jeered at, lampooned, "heckled," and
\par in all ways treated with utter disrespect. But as soon as they

\par invectives, charges of incompetence and folly, had been
\par showered from press and platform, excite unlimited faith.

\par to force on all who think, the inference that before meddling
\par with them they should be diligently studied. The nlere
\par facts, now familiar, that there is a connexion between the
\par number of marriages and the price of corn, and that in the
\par same society during the same generation, the ratio of crime
\par to population varies within narrow limits, should be sufficient
\par to make all see that human desires, using as guide such intellect
\par as is joined with them, act with approximate uniformity.
\par It should be inferred that among social causes, those initiated
\par by legislation, similarly operating with an average regularity,
\par must not only change men's actions, but, by consequence,
\par THE SINS OF LEGISLATORS. 101
\par change their natures-probably in ways not intended. There
\par should be recognition of the fact that social causation, Inore
\par than all other causation, is a fructifying causation; and it
\par should be seen that indirect and remote effects are no less
\par inevitable than proximate effects.. I do not mean that there
\par is denial of these statements and inferences. But there are
\par beliefs and beliefs-some which are held nonlinally, some
\par which influence conduct in small degrees, some which sway
\par it irresistibly under all circumstances; and unhappily the
\par beliefs of law-makers respecting causation in social affairs,
\par are of the superficial sort. Let us look at some of the truths
\par which all tacitly admit, but ,vhich scarcely any take account
\par of in legislation.
\par There is the indisputable fact that each human being is in
\par a certain degree modifiable, both physically and mentally.
\par Every theory of education, every discipline, from that of the
\par arithmetician to that of the prize-fighter, every proposed
\par reward for virtue or punishment for vice, implies the belief,
\par embodied in sundry proverbs, that the use or disuse of each
\par faculty, bodily or mental, is followed by an adaptive change
\par in it-loss of power or gain of power, according to demand.
\par There is the fact, also in its broader manifestations uni~
\par versally recognized, that modifications of structure, in one
\par way or other produced, are inheritable. Noone denies that
\par by the acculnulation of small changes, generation after generation,
\par constitution fits itself to conditions; so that a climate
\par which is fatal to other races is innocuous to the adapted race.
\par Noone denies that peoples who belong to the sanle original
\par stock, but have spread into different habitats where they
\par have led different lives, have acquired in course of time
\par different aptitudes and different tendencies. Noone denies
\par that under new conditions new national characters are even
\par now being Inoulded; as witness the Americans. And if
\par adaptation is everywhere and alw'ays going on, then adaptive
\par modifications must be set up by every change of social con..
\par ditions..

\par Beyond any hnmediate effect wrought, there is the remote

\par character: a re-Inoulding. which may be of a desirable kind
\par or of an undesirable kind, but which in any case is the most
\par important of the results to be considered.
\par Other general truths which the citizen, and still more the
\par legislator, ought. to contemplate until they become wrought
\par into his intellectual fabric, are disclosed when we .ask how
\par social activities are produced; and when we recognize the
\par obvious answer that they are the aggregate results of the
\par desires of individuals who are severally seeking satisfactions,
\par and ordinarily pursuing the ways which, with their preexisting
\par habits and thoughts, seem the easiest-following the
\par lines of least resistance: the truths of political economy
\par being so many sequences. It needs no proving that social
\par structures and social actions must in some way or other be
\par the outcome of human emotions guided by ideas-either those
\par of ancestors or those of living men. And that the right interpretation
\par of social phenomena is to be found in the
\par co-operation of these factors from generation to generation,
\par follows inevitably.
\par Such an interpretation soon brings us to the inference
\par that among men's desires seeking gratifications, those which
\par have pronlpted their private activities and their spontaneous
\par co-operations, have done much more towards social development
\par than those which have worked through governmental
\par agencies. That abundant crops now grow where once only
\par wild berries could be gathered, is due to the pursuit of individual
\par satisfactions through many centuries. The progress
\par from wigwams to good houses has resulted from wishes to
\par increase personal welfare; and towns bave arisen under the
\par like promptings. Beginning with traffic at gatherings on
\par THE SINS OF LEGISLATORS. 103
\par occasions of religious festivals, the trading organization, now
\par so extensive and complex, has been produced entirely by
\par men's efforts to achieve their private ends. Perpetually,
\par governments have thwarted and deranged the growth, but
\par have in no way furthered it; save by partially discharging
\par their proper function and maintaining social order. So, too,
\par with those advances of knowledge and those improvements
\par of appliances, by which these structural changes and these
\par increasing activities have been lnade possible. It is not to
\par the State that we owe the multitudinous useful inventions
\par from the spade to the telephone; it was not the State which
\par made possible extended navigation by a developed astronomy;
\par it was not the State which made the discoveries in
\par physics, chemistry, and the rest, which guide modern manufacturers;
\par it was not the State which devised the machinery
\par for producing fabrics of every kind, for transferring men
\par and things from place to place, and for ministering in a thousand
\par ways to our comforts. The world-wide transactions
\par conducted in merchants' offices, the rush of traffic filling our
\par streets, the retail distributing system. which brings everything
\par within easy reach and delivers the necessaries of life daily at
\par our doors, are not of governmental origin. All these are
\par results of the spontaneous activities of citizens, separate or
\par grouped. Nay, to these spontaneous activities governlnents
\par owe the very means of performing their duties. Divest the
\par political machinery of all those aids which Science and Art
\par have yielded it-leave it with those only which State-officials
\par have invented; and its functions would cease. The very
\par language in which its laws are registered and the orders of
\par its agents daily given, is an instrument not in the remotest
\par degree due to the legislator; but is one which has unawares
\par grown up during men's intercourse while pursuing their perBonal
\par satisfactions.

\par bound together that you cannot act on one part without

\par acting more or less on all parts. We see this unmistakably
\par when a cotton-famine, first paralyzing certain manufacturing
\par districts and then affecting the doings of ,vholesale and retail
\par distributors throughout the kingdom, as well as the people
\par they supply, goes on to affect the makers and distributors, as
\par well as the wearers, of other fabrics-woollen, linen, &c. Or
\par we see it when a rise in the price of coal, besides influencing
\par domestic life everywhere, hinders many of our industries,
\par raises the prices of the commodities produced, alters the
\par consumption of them, and changes the habits of consumers.
\par What we see clearly in these marked cases happens in every
\par case, in sensible or in insensible ways. And nlanifestly, Acts
\par of Parliament are among those factors which, beyond the
\par effects directly produced, have countless other effects of multitudinous
\par kinds. A.s I heard relnarked by a distinguished
\par professor, whose studies give ample means of judging"
\par When once you begin to interfere with the order of
\par Nature there is no knowing where the results will end."
\par And if this is true of that sub-human order of Nature
\par to which he referred, still more is it true of that order
\par of Nature existing in the social arrangements of human
\par beings.
\par And now to carry home the conclusion that the legislator
\par should bring to his\'b7 business a vivid consciousness of these
\par and other such broad truths concerning the society with
\par which he proposes to deal, let me present somewhat more
\par fully one of them not yet mentioned.
\par The continuance of every higher species of creature depends
\par on conformity, now to one, now to the other, of two
\par radically-opposed principles. The early lives of its members,
\par and the adult lives of its meulbers, have to be dealt with in
\par contrary ways. We will contemplate them in their natural
\par order.
\par One of the most familiar facts is that animals of superior
\par types, comparatively slow in reaching maturity, are enabled
\par THE SINS OF LEGISLATORS. lOG
\par when they have reached it, to give more aid to their off..
\par spring than aniInals of inferior types. The adults toster
\par their young during periods more or less prolonged, while
\par yet the young are unable to provide for themselves; and it
\par is obvious that maintenance of the species can be secured
\par only by this parental care. It requires no proving that the
\par blind unfledged hedge-bird, or the young puppy even after
\par it has\'b7 acquired sight, would forthwith die if it had to keep
\par itself \'b7warm and obtain its own food. The gratuitous aid
\par must be great in proportion as the young one is of little
\par worth, either to itself or to others; and it may diminish as
\par fast as, by increasing development, the young one acquires
\par worth, at first for self-sustentation, and by-and-by for sustentation
\par of others. That is to say, during imnlaturity, benefits
\par received nlust vary inversely as the power or ability of the
\par receiver. Clearly if during this first part of life benefits
\par were proportioned to merits, or re,vards to deserts, the
\par species would disappear in a generation.
\par From this }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of the family-group, let us turn to the
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 'regime }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of that larger group forIned by adult luembers of
\par the species. Asks what happens when the new individual,
\par acquiring complete use of its powers ~nd ceasing to have
\par parental aid, is left to itself. Now there comes into playa
\par principle just the reverse to that above described. Throughont
\par the rest of its life, each adult gets benefit in proportion
\par to merit-reward in proportion to desert: merit and desert
\par in each case being understood as ability to fulfil all the
\par requirements of life~to get food, to find shelter, to escape
\par enemies. Placed in conlpetition with members of its own
\par species and in antagonism with members of other species, it
\par dwindles and gets killed off, or thrives and propagates,
\par according as it is ill-endowed or well-endowed. 1t'Ianifestly
\par an opposite }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 could it be maintained, ,vould, in course
\par of time, be fatal. If the benefits received by each individual
\par ,vere proportionate' to its inferiority-if, as a consequence,
\par Inultiplication of the inferior was furthered, and multiplic8t

\par tion of the superior hindered, progressive degradation would
\par result; and eventually the degenerate species would fail to
\par hold its ground in presence of antagonistic species and competing
\par species.
\par The broad fact then, here to be noted, is that Nature's
\par modes of treatment inside the\'b7 family-group and outside the
\par family-group are diametrically opposed to one another; and
\par that the intrusion of either mode into the sphere of the
\par other, would be destructive either immediately or remotely.
\par Does anyone think that the like does not hold of the
\par human species? He cannot deny that within the human
\par family, as within any inferior falnily, it would be fatal to
\par proportion benefits to merits. Can he assert that outside the
\par family, among adults, there should not be, as throughout the
\par animal world, a proportioning of benefits to merits? Will he
\par contend that no mischief will result if the lowly endowed are
\par enabled to thrive and multiply as much as, or more than, the
\par highly endowed? A society of men, standing towards other
\par societies in relations of either antagonism or competition,
\par may be considered as a species, or, more literally, as a variety
\par of a species; and it Inust be true of it as of other species or
\par varieties, that it will be unable to hold its own in the struggle
\par with other societies, if it disadvantages its superior units that
\par it may advantage its inferior units. Surely none can fail to
\par see that were the principle of family life to be adopted and
\par fully carried out in social life-were reward always great in
\par proportion as desert was small, fatal results to the society
\par would quickly follow; and if so, then even a partial intrusion
\par of the family }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 into the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 regime }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 or the State, will be
\par slowly followed by fatal results. Society in its corporate capacity,
\par cannot without immediate or relnoter disaster interfere
\par with the play of these opposed principles under
\par which every species has reached such fitness for its lllode
\par of life as it possesses, and under which it maintains that
\par fitness.
\par THE SINS OF LEGISLATORS. 107
\par I say advisedly-society in its corporate capacity; not
\par intending to exclude or condemn aid given to the inferior by
\par the superior in their individual capacities. Though when
\par given so indiscriminately as to enable the inferior to multiply,
\par such aid entails mischief; yet in the absence of aid
\par given by society, individual aid:, more generally demanded
\par than now, and associated with a. greater sense of responsibility,
\par would, on the average, be given with the effect of
\par fostering the unfortunate worthy rather than the innately
\par unworthy: there being always, too, the concomitant social
\par 1:>enefit arising from culture of the sympathies. But all this
\par n~9,y be admitted while asserting that the radical distinction
\par between falnily-ethics and State-ethics must be maintained;
\par and that while generosity must be the essential principle of
\par the one, justice must be the essential principle of the othera
\par rigorous maintenance }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 those norlnal relations among
\par citizens under \'b7which each gets in return for his labour,
\par skilled or unskilled, bodily or mental, as much as is proved
\par to be its value by the demand for it: such return, therefore,
\par as will enable him to thrive and rear offspring in proportion
\par to the superiorities which lnake him valuable to himself and
\par others.
\par And yet, notwithstanding the conspicuousness of these
\par truths, which should strike everyone who leaves his lexicons,
\par and his law-deeds, and his ledgers, and looks abroad into that
\par natural order of things under which we exist, and to which
\par we must conform, there is continual advocacy of paternal
\par government. The intrusion of family-ethics into the ethics
\par of the State, instead of being regarded as socially injurious,
\par is more and more demanded as the only efficient means to
\par social benefit. So far has this delusion now gone, that it
\par vitiates the beliefs of those who luight, more than all others,
\par be thought safe from it. In the essay to which the Cobden
\par Olub awarded its prize in 1880, there occurs the assertion
\par that "the truth of Free Trade is clouded over by the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 laissezlaiJre

\par more parental governlnent-that bugbear of the old economists."
\par *
\par Vitally important as is the truth above insisted upon,
\par since acceptance or rejection of it affects the entire fabric of
\par political conclusions formed, I may be excused if I elnphasize
\par it by here quoting certain passages contained in a work I
\par published in 1851: premising, only, that the reader must
\par not hold me cOffilnitted to such teleological implications as
\par they contain. After describing" that state of universal warfare
\par maintained throughout the 10'w'er creation," and showing
\par that an average of benefit results from it, I have continued
\par thus:-
\par "Note further, that their carnivorous enemies not only remove from
\par herbivorous herds individuals past their prime, but also weed out the
\par sickly, the malformed, and the least fleet or powerful. By the aid of
\par which purifying process, as well as by the fighting so universal in the
\par pairing season, all vitiation of the race through the multiplication of
\par its inferior samples is prevented; and the maintenance of a constitution
\par completely adapted to surrounding conditions, and therefore most
\par productive of happiness, is ensured.
\par "The development of the higher creation is a progress towards a
\par form of being capable of a happiness undiminished by these drawbacks.
\par It is in the human race that the consummation is to be accomplished.
\par Civilization is the last stage\'b7 of its accomplishment. And the ideal
\par man is the man in whom all the conditions of that accomplishment are
\par fulfilled. Meanwhile, the well-being of existing humanity, and the
\par unfolding of it into this ultimate perfection, are both secured by that
\par same beneficent, though severe discipline, to which the animate creation
\par at large is subject: a discipline which is pitiless in the working
\par out of good: a felicity-pursuing law which never swerves for the avoidance
\par of partial and temporary suffering. The poverty of the incapable,
\par the distreE'ses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle,
\par and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong, which leave so
\par many 'in shallows and in miseries, ' are the decrees of a large, far-seeing
\par benevolence. "

\par And here we are brought round to our original topic-the
\par sins of legislators. Here there comes clearly before us the
\par commonest of the transgressions which rulers commit-a
\par transgression so comInon, and so sanctified by custom, that
\par no one imagines it to be a transgression. Here we see that,
\par as indicated at the outset, Government, begotten of aggression
\par and by aggression, ever continues to betray its original nature
\par by its aggressiveness; and that even what on its nearer face
\par seems beneficence only, shows, on its remoter face, not a little
\par maleficence-kindness at the cost of cruelty. For is it not
\par cruel to increase the sufferings of the better that the sufferings
\par of the worse may be decreased?
\par It is, indeed, marvellous how readily we let ourselves be
\par deceived by,vords and phrases which suggest one aspect of
\par the facts while leaving the opposite aspect unsuggested. A
\par good illustration of this, and one germane to the immediate
\par question, is seen in the use of the words "protection" and
\par " protectionist" by the antagonists of free-trade, and in the
\par tacit admission of its propriety by free-traders. While the
\par one party has habitually ignored, the other party has
\par habitually failed to enphasize, the truth that this so-called
\par protection always involves aggression; and that the name
\par aggressionist ought to be substituted for the name protectionist.
\par For nothing can be more certain than that if, to
\par maintain A's profit, B is forbidden to buy of C, or is fined to
\par the extent of the duty if he buys of C, then B is aggressed
\par upon that .A. may be " protected." Nay," aggressionists" is
\par a title doubly more applicable to the anti-free-traders than is
\par the euphemistic title "protectionists;" since, that one pro..
\par ducer luay gain, ten consumers are fleeced.
\par THE SINS OF LBGISLATORS. 115
\par Now just the like confusion of ideas, caused by looking
\par at one face only of the transaction, may be traced throughout
\par all the legislation which forcibly takes the property of this
\par man for the purpose of giving gratis benefits to that man.
\par IIabitually when one of the nUHlerous measures thus characterized
\par is discussed, the dominant thought is concerning the
\par pitiable J oneg who ig to be proteeted agg,ingt some evil;
\par while no thought is given to the hard-working Bro,vn w'ho
\par is aggressed upon, often much more to be pitied. Money
\par is exacted (either directly or through raised rent) from the
\par huckster who only by extreme pinching can pay her way,
\par froln the mason thrown out of work by a strike, from the
\par mechanic whose savings are melting away during an illness,
\par from the widow who washes or sews from dawn to dark to
\par feed her fatherless little ones; and all that the dissolute may
\par be saved from hunger, that the children of less impoverished
\par neighbours may have cheap lessons, and that various people,
\par mostly better off, may read newspapers and novels for nothing
\par ! The error of nomenclature is, in one respect, more
\par misleading than that which allows aggressionists to be called
\par protectionists; for, as just shown, protection of the vicious
\par poor involves aggression on the virtuous poor. Doubtless it
\par j,s true that the greater part of the money exacted COInes from
\par those who ai'e relatively well-off" But this is no consolation
\par to the ill-off from whom the rest is exacted. Nay, if the
\par comparison be made between the pressures borne by the two
\par classes respectively, it becomes manifest that the case is even
\par worse than at first appears; for while to the well-off the
\par exaction means loss of luxuries, to the ill-off it means loss of
\par necessaries.
\par And now see the Nemesis which is threatening to follow
\par this chronic sin of legislators. They and their class, in com..
\par mon with all ovvners of property, are in danger of suffering
\par from a sweeping application of that general principle practi..
\par cally asserted by each of these confiscating Acts of Parlia,l
\par ment. For what is the tacit assumption on which such Acts

\par proceed? It is the assumption that no man has any claim
\par to his property, not even to that which he has earned by the
\par sweat of his brow, save by permission of the comlnunity;
\par and that the cOlumunity nlay cancel the claim to any extent
\par it thinks fit. No defence can be made for this appropriation
\par of A's possessions for the benefit of B, save one which sets
\par out with the postulate that society as a whole has an absolute
\par right over the possessions of each member. And no"v this
\par doctrine, which has been tacitlyassulned, is being openly
\par proclaimed. Mr. George and his friends, Mr. Hyndman
\par and his supporters, are pushing the theory to its
\par logical issue. They have been instructed by examples,
\par yearly increasing in number, that the individual has no
\par rights but what the community may equitably over-ride;
\par and they are now saying-" It shall go hard but we
\par will better the instruction," and abolish individual rights
\par altogether.
\par Legislative misdeeds of the classes above indicated are in
\par large measure explained, and reprobation of them mitigated,
\par when we look at the matter from afar off. They have their
\par root ill the error that society is a manufacture; whereas it is
\par a growth. Neither the culture of past times nor the culture
\par of the present time, has given to any considerable number of
\par people a scientific conception of a society-a conception of
\par it as having a natural structure in which all its institutions,
\par governmental, religious, industrial, commercial, &c., are interdependently
\par bound-a structure which is in a sense organic.
\par Or if such a conception is nominally entertained, it is not
\par entertained in such way as to be operative on conduct. Contrariwise,
\par incorporated humanity is very commonly thought
\par of as though it were like so much dough which the cook can
\par mould as she pleases into pie-crust, or puff, or tartlet. The
\par conlmunist shows us unmistakably that he thinks of the body
\par politic as admitting of being shaped thus or thus at will;
\par and the tacit implication of many Acts of Parliament is that

\par rernain as intended.
\par It may indeed be said that, even irrespective of this erroneous
\par conception of a society as a plastic mass instead of as
\par an organized body, facts forced on his attention hour by hour
\par should make everyone sceptical as to the success of this or
\par that proposed way of changing a people's actions. Alike to
\par the citizen and to the legislator, horne-experiences daily supply
\par proofs that the conduct of human beings baulks calculation.
\par He has given up the thought of managing his wife and lets
\par her manage hiln. Children on v~hom he has tried now reprimand,
\par now punishment, now suasion, now reward, do not respond
\par satisfactorily to any method; and no expostulation
\par prevents their\'b7 mother from treating them' in ways he thinks
\par mischievous. So, too, his dealings with his servants, whether
\par by reasoning or by scolding, rarely succeed for long; the
\par falling short of attention, or punctuality, or cleanliness, or
\par sobriety, leads to constant changes. Yet, difficult as he finds
\par it to deal with humanity in detail, he is confident of his ability
\par to deal with embodied humanity. Citizens, not one-thousandth
\par of 'whom he knows, not one-hundredth of whom he ever saw,
\par and the great nlass of whom belong to classes having habits
\par and modes of thought of which he has but dim notions, he
\par feels sure will act in ,vays he foresees, and fulfil ends he wishes.

\par too vast, too varied, too involved, to be even vaguely pictured

\par with the greatest hesitation. Yet in this more than

\par Summing up the results of the discussion, may we not
\par reasonably say that there lie before the legislator several open
\par secrets, which yet are so open that they ought not to remain
\par secrets to one who undertakes the vast and terrible responsibility
\par of dealing 'with millions upon millions of human beings
\par by llleasures which, if they do not conduce to their happiness,
\par will increase their miseries and accelerate their deaths?
\par There is first of all the undeniable truth, conspicuous and
\par yet absolutely ignored, that there are no phenomena which a
\par society presents but what have their origins in the phenomena
\par of individual human life, which again have their roots in vital
\par phenomena at large. And there is the inevitable implication
\par that unless these vital phenomena, bodily and lllental, are
\par chaotic in their relations (a supposition excluded by the very
\par maintenance of life) the resulting phenomena cannot be wholly
\par chaotic: there lnust be some kind of order in the phenomena
\par which grow out of them when associated human beings have
\par to co-operate. Evidently, then, when one who has not studied
\par such resulting phenomena of social order, undertakes to regulate
\par society, he is pretty certain to work mischiefs.
\par In the second place, apart from }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 a priori }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 reasoning, this
\par conclusion should be forced on the legislator by comparisons
\par of societies. It ought to be sufficiently manifest that before
\par meddling with the details of social organization, inquiry
\par should be made whether social organization has a natural
\par history; and that to answer thie inquiry, it would be well,
\par setting out with the simplest societies, to see in what respects
\par social structures agree. Such comparative sociology, pursued
\par to a very small extent, shows a substantial uniformity
\par of genesis. The habitual existence of chieftainship, and the
\par establishment of chiefly authority by war; the rise every..
\par where of the medicine man and priest; the presence of a
\par THE SINS OF LEGISLATORS. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 119
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 cult having in all places the same :fundamental traits; the
\par traces of division of labour, early displayed, which gradually
\par beconle more marked; and the various complications, political,
\par ecclesiastical, industrial, which arise as groups are compounded
\par and re-colnpounded by war; prove to any who
\par compare them that, apart from all their special differences,
\par societies have general resemblances in their modes of origin
\par and development. They present traits of structure showing
\par that social organization has laws which over-ride individual
\par wills; and laws the disregard of which must be fraught with
\par disaster.
\par And then, in the third place, there is that mass of guiding
\par information yielded by the records of legislation in our own
\par country and in other countries, ,vhich still more obviously
\par demands attention. Here and elsewhere, attempts of multitudinous
\par kinds, made by kings and statesmen, have failed to
\par do the good intended and have worked unexpected evils.
\par Century after century new measures like the old ones, and
\par other measures akin in principle, have again disappointed
\par hopes and again brought disaster. And yet it is thought
\par neither by electors nor by those they elect, that there is any
\par need for systematic study of that law-making which in bygone
\par ages went on vvorking the ill-being of the people when
\par it tried to achieve their well-being. Surely there can be no
\par fitness for legislative functions without wide knowledge of
\par those legislative experiences which the past has bequeathed.
\par Reverting, then, to the analogy drawn at the outset, we
\par must say that the legislator is mlorally blameless or morally
\par blameworthy, according as he has or has not acquainted him\'b7
\par self with these several classes of facts. A physician who,
\par after years of study, has gained a competent knowledge of
\par physiology,pathology, and therapeutics, is not held crimi\'b7
\par nally responsible if a man dies under his treatment: he has
\par prepared himself as well as he can, and has acted to the best
\par of his judgment. Similarly the legislator wllose measures

\par and methodic inquiries which helped him to decide, cannot
\par be held to have committed more than an error of reasoning.
\par Contrariwise, the legislator who is wholly or in great part
\par uninformed concerning the masses of facts which he must
\par examine before his opinion on a proposed law can be of any
\par value, and who nevertheless helps to pass that law, can no

\par FROM time to time there returns on the\'b7 cautious thinker
\par the conclusion that, considered simply as a question of probabilities,
\par it is unlikely that his views upon any debatable
\par topic are correct. ' ,Here, ' , he reflects, ' 'are thousands
\par around me holding on this or that point opinions differing
\par from mine-wholly in many cases; partially in most others.
\par Each is as confident as I am of the truth of his convictions.
\par Many of them are possessed of great intelligence; and, rank
\par myself high as I may, I must admit that some are my equals
\par ---perhaps my superiors. Yet, vvhile everyone of us is sure
\par he is right, unquestionably most of us are wrong. Why
\par should not I be among the mistaken? True, I cannot realize
\par the likelihood that I am so. But this proves nothing; for
\par though the majority of us are necessarily in error, we all
\par labor under the inability to think we are in error. Is it not
\par then foolish thus to trust myself? A like warrant has. been
\par felt by men all the world through; and, in nine cases out of
\par ten, has proved a delusive warrant. Is it not then absurd
\par in me to put so much faith in my judgments?"
\par Barren of practical results as this reflection at first sight
\par appears, it may, and indeed should, influence some of our

\par constantly obliged to act out our inferences, trustless as they
\par may be; though in the house, in the office, in the street, there

\par that if to act is dangerous, never to act at all is fatal; and
\par though consequently, on our private conduct, this abstract
\par doubt as to the worth of our judgments must remain inoperative;
\par yet in our public conduct, we may properly allow it
\par to weigh. Here decision is no longer imperative; while the
\par difficulty of deciding aright is incalculably greater. Clearly
\par as we may think we see how a given measure will work,
\par we may infer, drawing the above induction from human
\par experience, that the chances are many against the truth of
\par our anticipations. Whether in most cases it is not wiser to
\par do nothing, becomes now a rational question. Continuing
\par his self-criticism, the cautious thinker may reason :-" If in
\par these personal affairs, where all the conditions of the case
\par were known to me, I have so often miscalculated, how much
\par oftener shall I miscalculate in political affairs, where the
\par conditions are too numerous, too widespread, too complex,
\par too obscure to be understood. Here, doubtless, is a social
\par evil and there a desideratum; and were I sure of doing no
\par mischief I would forthwith try to cure the one and achieve
\par the other. But when I remember how many of my private
\par schemes have miscarried; how speculations have failed,
\par agents proved dishonest, marriage been a disappointment;
\par how I did but pauperize the relative I sought to help; how
\par my carefully-governed son has turned out worse than most
\par children; how the thing I desperately strove against as a
\par misfortune did me immense good; how while the objects I
\par ardently pursued brought me little happiness when gained,
\par most of my pleasures have come from unexpected sources;
\par when I recall these and hosts of like facts, I am struck with
\par the incompetence of my intellect to prescribe for society.
\par And as the evil is one under which society has not only lived
\par but grown, while the desideratum is one it may spontaneously
\par obtain, as it has most others, in some unforeseen way, I
\par question the propriety of meddling."

\par the perennial faith of mankind better seen. Ever since society
\par existed Disappointment has been preaching, "Put not
\par your trust in legislation"; and yet the trust in legislation
\par seems scarcely diminished.
\par Did the State fulfil efficiently its unquestionable duties,
\par there would be some excuse for this eagerness to assign it
\par further duties. Were there no complaints of its faulty administration
\par of justice; of its endless delays and untold expenses;
\par of its bringing ruin in place of restitution; of its
\par playing the tyrant where it should have been the protector:
\par did we never hear of its complicated stupidities; its 20,000
\par statutes, which it assumes all Englishmen to know, and
\par which not one Englishman does know; its multiplied forms,
\par which, in the effort to meet every contingency, open far
\par . more loopholes than they provide against: had it not shown
\par its folly in the system of making every petty alteration by
\par a new act, variously affecting innumerable preceding acts;
\par or in its score of successive sets of Chancery rules, which so
\par modify, and limit, and extend, and abolish, and alter each
\par other, that not even Chancery lawyers know what the rules
\par are; were we never astounded by such a fact as that, under
\par the system of land registration in Ireland, \'a36,000 have been
\par spent in a "negative search" to establish the title of an
\par estate; did we find in its doing no such terrible incongruity
\par as the imprisonment of a hungry vagrant for stealing a

\par director it inflicts no punishment; had we, in short, proved
\par its efficiency as judge and defender, instead of having found
\par it treacherous, cruel, and anxiously to be shunned, there
\par would be some encouragement to hope other benefits at its
\par hands.
\par Or if, while failing in its judicial functions, the State
\par had proved itself a capable agent in some other department
\par --the military for example-there would have been some
\par show of reason for extending its sphere of action. Suppose
\par that it had rationally equipped its troops:, instead of giving

\par them cumbrous and ineffective m.uskets, barbarous grenadiercaps,
\par absurdly heavy knapsacks and cartouche-boxes, and
\par clothing colored so as admirably to help the enemy's marksmen;
\par suppose that it organized well and economically, instead
\par of salarying an immense superfluity of officers, creating
\par sinecure colonelcies of \'a34,000 a year, neglecting the meritorious
\par and promoting incapables, suppose that its soldiers
\par were always well housed instead of being thrust into barracks
\par that invalid hundreds, as at Aden, or that fall on their
\par occupants, as at Loodianah, where ninety-five were thus
\par killed; suppose that, in actual w'ar it had shown due administrative
\par ability, instead of occasionally leaving its regiments
\par to luarch barefoot, to dress in patches, to capture their own
\par engineering tools, and to fight on empty stomachs, as during
\par the Peninsular campaign; suppose all this, and the wish for
\par more State-control might still have had some warrant.
\par Even though it had bungled in everything else, yet had

\par for expecting success in a new field. Grant that the

\par passes in store, that" at least one-half were mere lumber";
\par let all these, we say, be held groundless charges, and there
\par would remain for the advocates of much government some
\par basis for their political air-castles, spite of military and
\par judicial mismanagement.
\par As it is, however, they seem to have read backwards the
\par parable of the talents. Not to the agent of proved efficiency
\par do they consign further duties, but to the negligent and
\par blundering agent. Private enterprise has done much, and
\par done it well. Private enterprise has cleared, drained, and
\par fertilized the country, and built the towns; has. excavated
\par mines, laid out roads, dug canals, and embanked railways;
\par has invented, and brought to perfection ploughs., looms,
\par steam-engines, printing-presses, and machines innumerable;
\par has built our ships, our vast manufactories, our docks; has
\par established banks, insurance societies, and the newspaper
\par press; has covered the sea with lines of steam-vessels, and
\par the land with electric telegraphs. Private enterprise has
\par brought agriculture, manufactures, and commerce to their
\par present height, and is now developing them with increasing
\par rapidity. Therefore, do not trust private enterprise. On
\par the other hand, the State so fulfils its judicial function as
\par to ruin many, delude others, and frighten away those who
\par most need succor; its national defences are so extravagantly
\par and yet inefficiently administered as to call forth almost
\par daily complaint, expostulation, or ridicule; and as the nation's
\par steward, it obtains from some of our vast public
\par estates a minus revenue. Therefore, trust the State. Slight
\par the good and faithful servant, and promote the unprofitable
\par one from one talent to ten.
\par Seriously, the case, while it may not, in some respects,
\par warrant this parallel, is, in one respect, even stronger. For
\par the new work is not of the same order as the old, but of
\par a more difficult order. III as government discharges its true
\par duties, any other duties committed to it are likely to be still
\par worse' discharged. To guard its subjects against aggression,
\par OVER-LEGISLATION. 127
\par either individual or national, is a straightforward and
\par tolerably simple matter; to regulate, directly or indirectly,
\par the personal actions of those subjects is an infinitely complicated
\par matter. It is one thing to secure to each man the
\par unhindered power to. pursue his own good; it is a widely
\par different thing to pursue the good for him. To do the first
\par efficiently, the State has merely to look on while its citizens
\par act; to forbid unfairness; to adjudicate when called on;
\par and to enforce restitution for injuries. To do the last
\par efficiently, it must become an ubiquitous worker-must\'b7know
\par each man's needs better than he knows them hims.elf-must,
\par in short, possess superhuman power and intelligence. Even,
\par therefore, had the State done well in its proper sphere, no
\par sufficient warrant would have existed for extending that
\par sphere; but seeing how ill it has discharged those simple
\par offices which we cannot help consigning to it, small indeed
\par is the probability that it will discharge well offices of a more
\par complicated nature.
\par Change the point of view however we may, and this conclusion
\par still presents itself. If we define the primary Stateduty
\par to be that of protecting each individual against others,
\par then, all other State-action comes under the definition of protecting
\par each individual against himself-against his own
\par fltupidity, his own idleness, his own improvidence, rashness,
\par or other defect-his own incapacity for doing something or
\par other which should be done. 1~here is no questioning this
\par classification. For manifestly all the obstacles that lie between
\par a man's desires and the satisfaction of them are either
\par obstacles arising from other men's counter-desires, or obstacles
\par arising from inability in himself. Such of these
\par counter-desires as are just, have as much claim to satisfaction
\par as his; and may not, therefore, be thw'arted. Such of
\par them as are unjust, it is the State '8 duty to hold in check.
\par The only other possible sphere }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 for }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 it, therefore, is that of
\par saving the individual from the consequences of his nature,
\par or, as we say-protecting him against himself. Making no

\par comment, at present, on the policy of this, and confining
\par ourselves solely to the practicability of it, let us inquire how
\par the proposal looks when reduced to its simplest form. Here
\par are men possessed of instincts, and sentiments, and perceptions,
\par all conspiring to self-preservation. The due action of
\par each brings its quantum of pleasure; the inaction, its more
\par or less of pain. Those provided with these faculties in due
\par proportions prosper and multiply; those ill-provided tend to
\par die out. And the general success of this human organization
\par is seen in the fact that under it the world has been
\par peopled, and by it the complicated appliances and arrangements
\par of civilized life have been developed. It is complained,
\par however, that there are certain directions in which
\par this apparatus of motives works but imperfectly. While it is
\par admitted that men are duly prompted by it to bodily sustenance,
\par to the obtainment of clothing and shelter, to marriage
\par and the care of offspring, and to the establishment
\par of the more important industrial and commercial agencies;
\par it is argued that there are many desiderata, as pure air, more
\par knowledge, good water, safe travelling, and so forth, which
\par it does not duly achieve. And these shortcomings being
\par assumed permanent, it is urged that some supplementary
\par means must be employed. It is therefore proposed that out
\par of the mass of men a certain number, constituting the legislature,
\par shall be instructed to attain these various objects.
\par The legislators thus instructed (all characterized, on the
\par average, by the same defects in this apparatus or motives
\par as men in general), being unable personally to fulfil their
\par tasks, must fulfil them by deputy-must appoint commissions,
\par boards, councils, and staffs of officers; and must construct
\par their agencies of this same defective humanity. that
\par acts so ill. Why now should this system of complex deputation
\par succeed where the system of simple deputation does
\par not? The industrial, commercial, and philanthropic agencies,
\par which citizens form spontaneously, are directly deputed
\par agencies; these governmental agencies made by electing legisOVER-
\par LEGISLATION. 129
\par lators who appoint officers are indirectly deputed ones. And
\par it is hoped that, by this process of double deputation, things
\par may be achieved which the process of single deputation will
\par not achieve. What is the rationale of this hope? Is it that
\par legislators, and their }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 employes, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 are made to feel more intensely
\par than the rest these evils they are to remedy, these
\par wants they are to satisfy? Hardly; for by position they are
\par mostly relieved from such evils and wants. Is it, then, that
\par they are to have the primary motive replaced by a secondary
\par motive-the fear of public displeasure, and ultimate removal
\par from office? Why scarcely; for the minor benefits which
\par citizens will not organize to secure }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 directly, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 they will not
\par organize to secure }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 indirectly, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 by turning out inefficient servants:
\par especially if they cannot readily get efficient ones.
\par Is it, then, that these State-agents are to do from a sense
\par of duty, what they would not do from any other motive?
\par Evidently this is the -only possibility remaining. The proposition
\par on which the advocates of much government have to
\par fall back is, that things which the people will not unite to
\par effect for personal benefit, a law-appointed portion of them
\par will\'b7 unite to effect for the benefit of the rest. Public men
\par and functionaries love their neighbors better than themselves!
\par The philanthropy of statesmen is stronger than the
\par selfishness of citizens!
\par No wonder, then, that every day adds to the list of legislative
\par miscarriages. If colliery explosions increase, notwithstanding
\par the appointment of coal-mine inspectors, why, it is
\par but a natural sequence to these false methods. If Sunderland
\par shipowners complain that, as far as tried, "the Mercantile
\par Marine Act has proved a total failure"; and if,
\par meanwhile, the other class affected by it-the sailors-show
\par their disapprobation by extensive strikes; why, it does but
\par exemplify the folly of trusting a theorizing benevolence
\par rather than an experienced self-interest. On all sides we
\par may expect such facts; and on all sides we find them. Government,

\par of covering the suburbs of th~ metropolis with thousands of

\par Thus, also, has it been in provincial towns. The
\par Nottingham Inclosure Act of 1845, by pres.cribing the. structure
\par of the houses. to be built, and the extent of yard or
\par garden to be allotted to each, has rendered it impossible to
\par build working-class dwellings at such moderate rents as to
\par compete with existing ones. It is estimated that, as a consequence,
\par 10,000 of the population \'b7are debarred from the
\par new homes they would otherwise have, and are forced to live
\par crowded together in miserable places unfit for human habitation;
\par and so, in its anxiety to insure healthy accommodation
\par for artisans, the law has entailed on them still worse accommodations
\par than before. Thus, too, has it been with the

\par with the Joint Stock Companies Registration Act. As was

\par Moreover, when these topical remedies applied by statesmen
\par do not exacerbate the evils they were meant to cure,
\par they constantly induce collateral evils; and these often
\par graver than the original ones. It is the vice of this empirical
\par school of politicians that they never look beyond proximate
\par causes and immediate effects. In common with the uneducated
\par masses they habitually regard each phenomenon as involving
\par but one antecedent and one consequent. They do
\par not bear in mind that each phenomenon is a link in an
\par infinite series-is the result of myriads of preceding phenomena,
\par and will have a share in producing myriads of
\par succeeding ones. Hence they overlook the fact that, in disturbing
\par any natural chain of sequences, they are not only
\par modifying the result next in succession, but all the future
\par results into which this will enter as a part-cause. The serial
\par genesis of phenomena, and the interaction of each series

Granting the absolute competence
\par of the State, let us consider what hope there is of getting
\par from it satisfactory performance. Let us look at the moving
\par force by which the legislative machine is worked, and
\par then inquire whether this force is thus employed as economically
\par as it would otherwise be.
\par Manifestly, as desire of some kind is the invariable stimu<
\par Ius to action in the individual, every social agency, of what
\par nature soever, must have some aggregate of desires for its
\par motive power. Men in their collective capacity can exhibit
\par no result but what has its origin in some appetite, feeling,
\par or taste common among them. Did not they like meat, there
\par could be no cattle-graziers., no Smithfield, no distributing organization
\par of butchers. Operas, philharmonic societies, songbooks,
\par and street organ-boys, have all been called into being
\par by our love of music. Look through the trades' directory;
\par take up a guide to the London sights; read the index of
\par Bradshaw's time-tables, the reports of the learned societies,
\par or the advertisements of new books; and you see in the publication
\par itself, and in the things it describes, so many products
\par of human activities, stimulated by human desires. Under
\par this stimulus grow up agencies alik!) the mos.t gigantic
\par and the most insignificant, the most complicated and the most
\par simple-agencies for national defence and for the s.weeping
\par of crossings; for the daily distribution of letters, and for
\par the collection of bits, of coal out of the Thames mud; agen..
\par OVER-LEGISLATION. 137
\par cies that subserve all ends, from the preaching of Christianity
\par to the protection of ill-treated animals; from the
\par production of bread for a nation to the suppl:r of groundsel
\par for caged singing-birds.. The accumulated desires }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 individuals
\par being, then, the moving power by which every social
\par agency is worked, the question to be considered is, Which is
\par the most economical kind of agency 1 The agency having no
\par power in itself, but being merely an instrument, our inquiry
\par must be for the most efficient instrument; the instrument
\par that costs least, and wastes the smallest amount of the moving
\par power; the instrument least liable to get out of order,
\par and most readily put right again when it goes wrong. Of
\par the two kinds of social mechanism exemplified above, the
\par spontaneous and the governmental, which' is the best ~
\par From the form of this question will be readily foreseen
\par the intended ans.wer, that is the best mechanism which contains
\par the fewest parts. The common saying, "What you
\par wish well done you must do yourself," embodies a truth
\par equally applicable to political life as, to private life. The
\par experience that farming by bailiff entails loss., while tenantfaruling
\par pays, is an experience still better illustrated in na.tional
\par history than in a landlord's account-books. This
\par transference of power from constituencies to members of
\par Parliament, from these to the executive, from the executive
\par to a board, from the board to inspectors, and from inspectors
\par through their subs down to the actual workers-this operating
\par through a series of levers, each of which absorbs in
\par friction and inertia part of the moving force; is as bad, in
\par virtue of its complexity, as the direct employment by society
\par of individuals, private companies, and spontaneously-formed
\par institutions, is good in virtue of its simplicity. Fully to
\par appreciate the contrast, w~ must compare in detail the working
\par of the two systems.
\par Officialism is habitually slow. When non-governmental
\par agencies are dilatory, the public has its remedy: it ceases
\par to employ them and soon finds quicker ones. Under this

\par discipline all private bodies are taught promptness. But for
\par delays in State-departments there is no such easy cure. Lifelong
\par Chancery suits must be patiently borne; Museumcatalogues
\par must be wearily waited for. While, by the people
\par themselves, a Crystal Palace is designed, erected, and filled,
\par in the course of a few months, the legislature takes twenty
\par years to build itself a new house. While, by private persons,
\par the debates are daily printed and dispersed over the kingdom
\par within a few hours of their utterance, the Board of
\par Trade tables are regularly published a month, and sometimes
\par more, after date. And so throughout. Here is a
\par Board of Health which, since 1849, has been about to close
\par the metropolitan graveyards, but has not done it yet; and
\par which has so long dawdled over projects for cemeteries., that
\par the London Necropolis Company has taken the matter out of
\par its hands. Here is a patentee who has had fourteen years'
\par correspondence with the Horse Guards, before getting a
\par definite answer respecting the use of his improved boot for
\par the Army. Here is a Plymouth port-admiral who delays
\par sending out to look for the missing boats of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Am,azon
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 until ten days after the wreck.
\par Again, officialism is stupid. Under the natural course of
\par things each citizen tends towards his fittest function. Those
\par who are competent to the kind of work they undertake,
\par succeed, and, in the average of cases, are advanced in proportion
\par to their efficiency; while the incompetent, society soon
\par finds out, ceases to employ, forces to try something easier,
\par and eventually turns to use. But it is quite otherwise in
\par State-organizations. Here, as everyone knows, birth, age,
\par backstairs intrigue, and sycophancy, determine the selections
\par rather than merit. The' 'fool of the family" readily finds
\par a place in the Church, if "the family" have good connections.
\par A youth too ill-educated for any profession does very
\par well for an officer in the Army. Grey hair, or a title, is. a
\par far better guarantee of naval promotion than genius is.
\par Nay, indeed, the man of capacity often finds that, in governOVER-
\par LEGISLATION. 139
\par ment offices, superiority is a hindrance-that his chiefs hate
\par to be pestered with his proposed improvements, and are
\par offended by his implied criticisms. Not only, therefore, is
\par legislative machinery complex, but it is made of inferior
\par materials. Hence the blunders we daily read of; the supplying
\par to the dockyards from the royal forests of timber unfit
\par for use; the administration o\'a3 relie\'a3 during the Irigh famine
\par in such a manner as to draw laborers from the field, and
\par diminish the subsequent harvest by one-fourth; the filing
\par of patents at three different offices and keeping an index at
\par none. Everywhere does this bungling show itself, from the
\par elaborate failure of House of Commons ventilation down to
\par the publication of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 The London Gazette, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 which invariably
\par comes. out wrongly folded.
\par A further characteristic of officialism is its extravagance.
\par In its chief departments, Army, Navy, and Chureh, it employs
\par far more officers than are needful, and pays some of
\par the useless ones exorbitantly. The work done by the Sewers
\par Commission has cost, as Sir B. Hall tells us., from 300 to
\par 400 per cent. over the ,contemplated outlay; while the management
\par charges have reached thirty-five, forty, and fortyfive
\par per cent. on the expenditure. The trustees of Ramsgate
\par Harbor-a harbor, by the way, that has taken a century to
\par complete-are spending \'a318,000 a year in doing what
\par \'a35,000 has been proved sufficient for. The Board of Health
\par is causing new surveys to be made of all the towns under its
\par control-a proceeding which, as Mr. Stephenson states, and
\par as every tyro in engineering knows, is, for drainage purposes,
\par a wholly needless expense. These public agencies
\par are subject to no such influence as that which obliges private

\par cannot saddle the nation with the results of their extravagance,
\par and so are prevented from being extravagant. On

\par A shopkeeper leaves out -of his accounts no item analogous

\par to be deducted on the way to the Exchequer. Walk through

\par or ruin, dictate the saving of every penny; visit one
\par of the national dockyards, and the comments you make on
\par any glaring wastefulness are carelessly met by the slang
\par phrase, "Nunky:Xc pays."
\par The unadaptiveness of' officialism is another of its vices.
\par Unlike private enterprise which quickly modifies its actions
\par to meet emergencies; unlike the shopkeeper who promptly
\par finds the wherewith to satisfy a sudden demand; unlike the
\par railway-\'b7company which doubles its trains to carry a special
\par influx of passengers; the law-made instrumentality lumbers
\par on under all varieties of circumstances through its ordained
\par routine at its habitual rate. By its very nature it is fitted
\par only for average requirements, and inevitably fails under
\par unusual requirements. You cannot step into the street
\par without having the contrast thrust upon you. Is it summer?
\par You see the water-carts going their prescribed rounds
\par with scarcely any regard to the needs of the weather-to-day
\par sprinkling afresh the already moist roads; to-morrow bestowing
\par their showers with no greater liberality upon roads
\par cloudy with dust. Is it winter? You see the scavengers do
\par not vary in number and activity according to the quantity
\par of mud; and if there comes a heavy fall of snow, you find
\par the thoroughfares remaining for nearly a week in a scarcely
\par passable state, without an effort being made, even in the
\par heart of London, to meet the exigency. The late snow-storm,
\par indeed, supplied a neat antithesis between the two orders of
\par "Nunky" diminutive of "uncle." As we would say, "Uncle
\par Sam pays."

\par agencies in the effects it respectively produced un omnibuses
\par and cabs. Not being under a law-fixed tariff, the omnibuses
\par put on extra horses and raised their fares. The cabs, on the
\par contrary, being limited in their charges by an Act of Parliament
\par which, with the usual shortsightedness, never contemplated
\par such a contingency as this, declined to ply, deserted
\par the stands and the stations, left lueklesg travellers to stumble
\par home with their luggage as best they might, and so became
\par useless at the very time of all others when they were most
\par wanted! Not only by its unsusceptibility of adjustment
\par does officialism\'b7 entail serious inconveniences, but it likewise
\par entails great injustices. In this case of cabs, for example, it
\par has resulted since the late change of law, that old cabs, which
\par were before saleable at \'a310 and \'a312 each, are now unsaleable
\par and have to be broken up; and thus legislation has robbed
\par cab-proprietors of part of'their capital. Again, the recentlypassed
\par Smoke-Bill for London, which applies only within
\par certain prescribed limits, has the effect of taxing one manufacturer
\par while leaving untaxed his competitor working within
\par a quarter of a mile; and so, as we are credibly informed,
\par gives one an advantage of \'a31,500 a year over another. These
\par typify the infinity of wrongs, varying in degrees of hardship,
\par which legal regulations necessarily involve. Society,
\par a living, growing organism, placed within apparatuses of
\par dead, rigid, mechanical formulas, cannot fail to be hampered
\par and pinched. The only agencies which can efficiently serve
\par it are those through which its pulsations hourly flow, and
\par which change as it changes.
\par How invariably officiali~m becomes corrupt everyone
\par knows. Exposed to no such antiseptic as free competition
\par -not dependent for existence, as private unendowed organizations
\par are, on the maintenance of a vigorous vitality;
\par all law-made agencies fall into an inert, over-fed state, from
\par which to disease is a short step. Salaries flow in irrespective
\par of the activity with which duty is performed; continue after
\par duty wholly ceases; become rich prizes for the idle well142

\par To all which broad contrasts add this, that while private
\par bodies are enterprising and progressive,. public bodies are
\par unchanging, and, indeed, obstructive. That officialism
\par should be inventive nobody expects. That it should go out
\par of its easy mechanical routine to introduce improvements,
\par and this at a considerable expense of thought and applica~
\par tion, without the prospect of profit, is not to be supposed.
\par But it is not simply stationary; it resists every amendment
\par either in itself or in anything with which it deals. Until
\par now that county courts, are taking away their practice, all
\par agents of the law have doggedly opposed law-reform. The
\par universities have maintained an old }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 curriculum }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 for centuries

\par that though, as already mentioned, Professor Barlow reported
\par in 1820, of the Admiralty compasses then in store,

\par to be readily overborne even by a powerful
\par public opinion: witness the fact that though, for generations,
\par nine-tenths of the nation have disapproved this ecclesiastical
\par system which pampers the drones and starves the
\par workers, and though commissions have been appointed to
\par rectify it, it still remains substantially as it was: witness
\par again the. fact that though, since 1818, there have been a
\par score of attempts to rectify the scandalous maladministration
\par of charitable trusts-though ten times in ten successive

\par these imperfections of humanity are shared by State-functionaries;
\par and that being unchecked in them by the same
\par stern discipline, they grow to far worse results. Given a
\par race of men having a certain proclivity to misconduct, and
\par the question is, whether a society of these men shall be so
\par organized that ill-conduct directly brings punishment, or
\par whether it shall be so organized that punishment is but remotely
\par contingent on ill-conduct? Which will be the most
\par healthful community-that in which agents who perform
\par their functions badly, immediately suffer by the withdrawal
\par OVER-LEGISLATION. 145
\par of public patronage; or that in which such agents can be
\par made to suffer only through an apparatus of meetings, petitions,
\par polling-booths, parliamentary divisions, cabinet-councils,
\par and red-tape documents ~ Is it not an absurdly utopian
\par hope that men will behave better when correction is far
\par removed and unce\'b7rtain than when it is near at hand and
\par inevitable 1 Yet this is the hope whi~h most politi~al s~hemers
\par unconsciously cherish. Listen to their plans, and you
\par find that just what they propose to have done, they assume
\par the appointed agents will do. That functionaries are trustworthy
\par is their first postulate. Doubtless could good officers
\par be ensured, much might be said for officialism; just as despotism
\par would have its advantages could we ensure a good
\par despot.
\par If, however, we would duly appreciate the contrast
\par between the artificial modes and the natural modes of achieving
\par social desiderata, we must look not only at the vices of the
\par one but at the virtues of the other. These are many and important.
\par Consider first how immediately every private enterprise
\par is dependent on the need for it; and how impossible
\par it is for it to continue if there be no need. Daily are new
\par trades and new companies established. If they subserve
\par some existing public want, they take root and grow. If they
\par do not, they die of inanition. It needs no agitation, no act
\par of Parliament, to put them down. As with all natural organizations,
\par if there is no function for them no nutriment
\par comes to them, and they dwindle away. Moreover, not only
\par do the new agencies disappear if they are superfluous, but
\par the old ones cease to be when they have done their work.
\par Unlike public instrumentalities; unlike heralds' offices,
\par which are maintained for ages after heraldy has lost all
\par value; unlike ecclesiastical courts, which continue to flourish
\par for generations after they have become an abomination;
\par these private instrumentalities dissolve when they become
\par needless. A widely ramified coaching-system ceases to exist
\par as soon as a more efficient railway-system comes into

\par being. And not simply does it cease to exist, and to ab\'b7
\par stract funds, but the materials of which it was made are
\par absorbed and turned to use. Coachmen, guarq.s, and the
\par rest, are employed to profit elsewhere; do not continue
\par for twenty years a burden, like the compensated officials
\par of some abolished department of the State. Consider,
\par again, how necessarily these unordained agencies fit themselves
\par to their work. It is a law of all organized things that
\par efficiency presupposes apprenticeship. Not only is it true
\par that the young merchant must begin by carrying letters to
\par the post, that the way to be a successful innkeeper is to commence
\par as waiter; not only is it true that in the development
\par of the intellect there must come first the perceptions of identity
\par and dl1ality, next of number, and that without these,
\par arithmetic, algebra, and the infinitesimal calculus, remain
\par impracticable; but it is true that there is no part of an or\'b7
\par ganism but begins in some simple form with some insignifi.
\par cant function, and passes to its final stage through successive
\par phases of complexity. Every heart is at first a mere pulsatile
\par sac; every brain begins as a slight enlargement of the
\par spinal cord. This law equally extends to the social organism.
\par An instrumentality that is to work well must not be designed
\par and suddenly put together by legislators, but must
\par grow gradually from a germ; each successive addition must
\par be tried and proved good by experience before another addition
\par is made; and by this tentative process only, can an
\par efficient instrumentality be produced. From a trustworthy
\par man who receives deposits of money, insensibly grows up a
\par vast banking-system, with its notes, checks, bills, its complex
\par transactions, and its clearing-house. Pack-horses, then
\par wagons, then coaches, then steam-carriages on common roads,
\par and, finally, steam-carriages on roads made for them-such
\par has been the slow genesis of our present means of communication.
\par Not a trade in the directory but has formed itself
\par an apparatus of manufacturers, brokers, travellers, and retailers,
\par in so gradual a way that no one can trace the steps.
\par OVER-LEGISLATION. 147
\par And so with organizations of another order. The Zoological
\par Gardens began as the private collection of a few naturalists.
\par The best working-class school known-that at Price's factory
\par -commenced with half-a-dozen boys sitting among the
\par candle-boxes, after hours, to teach themselves writing with
\par worn-out pens. Mark, too, that asa consequence of their
\par mode of growth, these spontaneously-formed a,geneies expand
\par to any extent required. The same stimulus which
\par brought them into being makes them send their ramifications
\par wherever they are needed. But supply does not thus
\par readily follow demand in governmental agencies. Appoint
\par a board and a staff, fix their duties, and let the apparatus
\par have a generation or two to consolidate, and you cannot get
\par it to fulfil larger requirements without some Act of Parliament
\par obtained only after long delay and difficulty.
\par Were there space, much more might be said upon the
\par superiority of what naturalists would call the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 exogenous

one. But, from
\par the point of view indicated, the further contrasts between
\par their characteristics will be sufficiently visible.
\par Hence then the fact, that while the one order of means
\par is ever failing, making worse, or producing more evils than
\par it cures, the other order of means is ever succeeding, ever
\par improving. Strong as it looks at the outset, State-agency
\par perpetually disappoints everyone. Puny as are its first
\par stages, private effort daily achieves results that astound
\par the world. It is not only that joint-stock companies do so
\par much; it is not onlY. that by them a whole kingdom is covered
\par with railways in the same time that it takes the Adluiralty
\par to build a hundred-gun ship; but it is that public

\par Where, then, is the warrant for the constantly proposed

\par the evils they aim at; if, in another large class, they make
\par these evils worse instead of remedying them; and if, in a

\par and often greater ones; if, as we lately saw, public action
\par is continually outdone in efficiency by private action; and

\par quoted, showing that the State is likely to do more harm
\par than good in attempting this; nor to dwell upon the fact
\par that, in most of the alleged cases, the apparent insufficiency

\par as may be conclusively shown; let us deal with the
\par proposition on its own terms. Though there would have
\par been no need for a Mercantile Marine Act to pre\'a5ent the
\par unseaworthiness of ships and the ill-treatment of sailors,
\par had there been no Navigation Laws to produce these; and
\par though were all like cases of evils and shortcomings directly
\par or indirectly produced by law, taken out\'b7 of the category,
\par there would probably remain but s.mall basis for the plea
\par above put; yet let it be granted that, every. artificial obstacle
\par having been removed, there would still remain many desiderata
\par unachieved, which there was no seeing how spontaneous
\par effort could achieve. Let all this, we say, be granted;
\par the propriety of legislative action may yet be rightly
\par questioned.
\par For the said plea involves the unwarrantable assumption
\par that social agencies will continue to work only as they
\par are now working; and will produce no results but those
\par they seem likely to produce. It is the habit of this school
\par of thinkers to make a limited human intelligence the
\par measure of phenomena which it requires omniscience to
\par grasp. That which it does not see the way to, it does not
\par believe will take place. Though society has, generation
\par after generation, been growing to developments which none
\par foresaw, yet there is no practical belief in unforeseen developments
\par in the future. The Parliamentary debates constitute
\par an elaborate balancing of probabilities, having for
\par data things as they are. Meanwhile every day adds new
\par elements to things as they are, and seemingly improbable
\par results constantly occur. Who, a few years ago, expected

\par population would spontaneously cure itself, as it is now
\par doing? So far from social changes arising in likely ways,
\par they usually arise in ways which, to common sense, appear
\par unlikely. A barber's shop was not a probable-looking place
\par for the germination of the cotton-manufacture. No one
\par . supposed that important agricultural improvements would
\par come from a Leadenhall Street tradesman. A farmer
\par would have been the last man thought of to bring to bear
\par the screw-propulsion of steamships.. The invention of a
\par new species of architecture we should have hoped from any
\par one rather than a gardener. Yet while the most unexpected
\par changes are daily wrought out in the strangest ways, legislation
\par daily assumes that things will go just as human
\par foresight thinks they will go. Though by the trite exclamation,
\par "What would our forefathers have said!" there is
\par a frequent acknowledgment of the fact that wonderful
\par results have been achieved in modes wholly unforeseen, yet
\par there seems no belief that this will be again. Would it not
\par be wise to admit such a probability into our politics? May
\par we not rationally infer that, as in the past, so in the future?
\par This strong faith in State-agencies is, however, accompanied
\par by so weak a faith in natural agencies (the two
\par being antagonistic), that, in spite of past experience, it
\par will by many be thought absurd to rest in the conviction
\par that existing social needs will be spontaneously met, though
\par we cannot say how they will be met. Nevertheless, illustrations
\par exactly to the point are now transpiring before their
\par eyes. Instance the scarcely credible phenomenon lately
\par witnessed in the midland counties. Everyone has heard
\par of the distress of the stockingers; a chronic evil of some
\par generation or two's standing. Repeated petitions have
\par prayed Parliament for remedy; and legislation has made
\par attempts, but without success. The disease seemed incurable.
\par Two or three years since, however, the circular knitting
\par machine was introduced; a machine immensely outstripping
\par the old stocking-frame in productiveness, but which can
\par OVER-LEGISLATION. 153
\par make only the legs of stockings, not the feet. Doubtless,
\par the Leicester and Nottingham artisans regarded this new
\par engine with alarm, as likely to intensify their miseries. On
\par the contrary, it has wholly removed them. By cheapening
\par production it has so enormously increased consumption,
\par that the old stocking-frames, which were before too many
\par by half for the w'ork to be done, are now all employed in
\par putting feet to the legs which the new machines make. How
\par insane would he have been thought who anticipated cure
\par from such a cause! If from the unforeseen removal of evils
\par we turn to the unforeseen achievement of desiderata, we
\par find like cases. No one recognized in Oersted's electromagnetic
\par discovery the germ of a new agency for the catching
\par of criminals and the facilitation of commerce. No one
\par expected railways to become agents for the diffusion of
\par cheap literature, as they now are. Noone supposed when
\par the Society of Arts was planning an international exhibition
\par of manufacturers in Hyde Park, that the result would
\par be a place for popular recreation and culture at Sydenham.
\par But there is yet a deeper reply to the appeals of impatient
\par philanthropists. It is not simply that social
\par vitality may be trusted by-and-by to fulfil each muchexaggerated
\par requirement in some quiet spontaneous wayit
\par is not simply that when thus naturally fulfilled it will
\par be fulfilled efficiently, instead of being botched as when
\par attempted artificially; but it is that until thus naturally
\par fulfilled it ought not to. be fulfilled at alL A startling paradox,
\par this, to many; but one quite justifiable, as we hope
\par shortly to show.
\par It was pointed out some distance back, that the force
\par which produces and sets in motion every social me,chanism
\par -governmental, mercantile, or other~is some accumulation
\par of personal desires. As there is no individual action without
\par a desire, so, .it was urged, there can be no social a.ction
\par without an aggregate of desires. To which there here
\par remains to add, that as it is a general law of the individual
\par 154 THE MAN }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 VERSUS }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 THE STATE.
\par that the intenser desires-those corresponding to all-essential
\par functions-are satisfied first, and if need be to the
\par neglect of the weaker and less important ones; so, it must
\par be a general law of society that the chief requisites of social
\par life-those necessary to popular existence and multiplication-
\par will, in the natural order of things, be subserved
\par before those of a less pressing kind. As the private man
\par first ensures himself food; then clothing and shelter; these
\par being secured, takes a wife; and, if he can afford it, presently
\par supplies himself with carpeted rooms, and a piano,
\par and wines, hires servants and gives dinner-parties; so, in
\par the evolution of society, we see first a combination for
\par defence against enemies, and for the better pursuit of game;
\par by-and.,;by come such political arrangements as are needed
\par to maintain this combination; afterwards, under a demand
\par for more food, more clothes, more houses, arises division
\par of labor; and when satisfaction of the animal wants. has
\par been provided for, there slowly grow up literature, science,
\par and the arts. Is it not obvious that these successive evolutions
\par occur in the order of their importance? Is it not
\par obvious, that, being each of them produced by an aggregate
\par of desires, they }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 must }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 occur in the order of their importance,
\par if it be a law of the individual that the strongest desires
\par correspond to the most needful actions? Is it not, indeed,
\par obvious that the order of relative importance will be more
\par uniformly followed in social action than in individual
\par action; seeing that the personal idiosyncrasies which disturb
\par that order in the latter case are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 averaged }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 in the former?

\par describing life at the gold-diggings. There he will find the

\par for food that it pays better to keep a store than to dig.

\par ness. This brings drays and horses into demand; the high
\par rates draw these from all quarters; and, after them, wheelwrights
\par and harness-makers. Blacksmiths to sharpen
\par pickaxes, doctors to cure fevers, get pay exorbitant in proportion
\par to the need for them; and are so brought flocking
\par in proportionate numbers. Presently commodities become
\par scarce; more must be tetched trom abroad; sailors must
\par have increased wages to prevent them from deserting and
\par turning miners; this necessitates higher charges for freight;
\par higher freights quickly bring more ships; and so there
\par rapidly develops an organization for supplying goods from
\par all parts of the world. Every phase of this evolution takes
\par place in the order of its necessity; or, as we say, in the
\par order of the intensity of the desires subserved. Each man
\par does that which he finds pays best; that which pays best
\par is that for which other men will give most; that for which
\par they will give most is that which, under the circumstances,
\par they most desire. Hence the suc.cession must be through~
\par out from the most important to the les'S important. A
\par requirement which at any period remains unfulfilled, must
\par be one for the fulfilment of which men will not pay so
\par much as to make it worth anyone's while to fulfil it-must
\par be a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 less }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 requirement than all the others for the fulfilment
\par of which they will pay more; and must wait until other
\par more needful things are done. Well, is it not clear that
\par the same law holds good in. every community? Is it not
\par true of the latter phases of social evolution, as of the earlier,
\par that when things are let alone the smaller desiderata will
\par be postponed to the greater?
\par Hence, then, the justification of the seeming paradox,
\par that until spontaneously fulfilled, a public want should not
\par be fulfilled at all. It must, on the average, result in our
\par complex state, as in simpler ones, that the thing left undone
\par is a thing by doing which citizens cannot gain so much as
\par by doing other things; is therefore a thing which soc.iety
\par does not want done so much as it wants these other things

\par done; and the corollary is, that to effect a neglected thing
\par by artificially employing citizens to do it, is to leave undone
\par some more important thing which they would have been
\par doing; is to sacrifice the greater requisite to the smaller.
\par "But," it will perhaps be objected, "if the things done
\par by a government, or at least by a representative government,
\par are also done in obedience to some aggregate desire,
\par why may we not look for this normal subordination of the
\par more needful to the less needful in them too?" The reply
\par is, that though they have a certain tendency to follow this
\par order; though those primal desires for public defence and
\par personal protection, out of which government originates,
\par were satisfied through its instrumentality in proper succession;
\par though, possibly, some other early and simple requirements
\par may have been so too; yet, when the desires
\par are not few, universal and intense, but, like those remaining
\par to be satisfied in the latter stages of civilization, numerous,

\par varying in every case, the want that is most pressing, is a
\par task which no legislature can accomplish. No man or men

\par be the more conclusive, we will take a case in which the
\par ruling power is deemed specially fit to decide. We refer
\par to our means of communication.
\par Do those who maintain that railways would have been
\par better laid out and \'b7constructed by government, hold that
\par the order of importanee would have been as uniformly fol..
\par lowed as it has been by private enterprise ? Under the
\par stimulus of an enormous traffic-a traffic too great for the
\par then existing means-the first line sprung up between
\par Liverpool and Manchester. Next came the\'b7 Grand Junction
\par and the London and Birmingham (now merged in the London
\par and Northwestern); afterwards the Great Western,
\par the Southwestern, the Southeastern, the Eastern Counties,
\par the Midland. Since then subsidiary lines and branches have
\par occupied our capitalists. As they were quite certain to do,
\par companies made first the most needed, and therefore the
\par best paying, lines; under the same impulse that a laborer
\par chooses high wages in preference to low. That government
\par would have adopted a better order can hardly be, for the
\par best has been followed; but that it would have adopted a
\par worse, all the evidence we have goes to show. In default
\par of materials for a direct parallel, we might cite from India
\par and the colonies, cases of injudicious road-making. Or, as
\par exemplifying State-efforts to facilitate communication, we
\par might dwell on the fact that while our rulers have sacrificed

\par a Northwest passage, which would be useless if found, they
\par have left the exploration of the Isthmus of Panama, and

\par companies. But, not to make much of this indirect evidence,
\par we will content ourselves with the one sample of a
\par State-made channel for commerce, which we have at home

\par as given in its forty-seventh annual report, issued in 1852,
\par are-receipts during the year, \'a37,909; expenditure ditto,

\par are }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of the same kind, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 how worthless a judge must it be when
\par they are of different kinds. If, where a fair share of intelligence
\par might be expected to lead them right, legislators and
\par their officers go so wrong, how terribly will they err where
\par no amount of intelligence would suffice them,-where they
\par must decide among hosts of needs, bodily, intellectual, and
\par moral, which admit of no direct comparisons; and how disastrous
\par must be the results if they act out their erroneous
\par decisions. Should anyone need this bringing home to him
\par by an illustration, let him read the following extract from
\par the last of the series of letters some time since published in
\par the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Morning Chronicle, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 on the state of agriculture in France.
\par After expressing the opinion that French farming is some
\par century behind English farming, the writer goes on to say:
\par There are two causes principally chargeable with this. In the
\par first place, strange as it may seem in a country in which two-thirds
\par of the population are agriculturists, agriculture is a very unhonoured
\par occupation. Develop in the slightest degree a Frenchman's
\par mental faculties, and he flies to a town as surely as steel filings
\par fly to a loadstone. He has no rural tastes, no delight in rural
\par habits. A French amateur farmer would indeed be a sight to see.
\par Again, this national tendency is directly encouraged by the centralizing
\par system of government-by the multitude of officials, and
\par by the payment of all functionaries. From all parts of France,
\par men of great energy and resource struggle up, and fling themselves
\par on the world of Paris. There they try to become great
\par functionaries. Through every department * of the eighty-four, men
\par of less energy and resource struggle up to the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 chef-lieu--the
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 provincial capital. There they try to become little functionaries.
\par * The departments are political subdivisions, created by redistricting
\par the old provinces of France.-ED.
\par OVER-LEGISJ.JATION. 159
\par Go still lower-deal with a still smaller scale-and the result will
\par be the same. As is the department to France, so is the arrondissement
\par to the department, and the commune to the arrondissement.
\par All who have, or think they have, heads on their shoulders, struggle
\par into towns to fight for office. All who are, or are deemed by
\par themselves or others, too stupid for anything else, are left at home
\par to till the fields, and breed the cattle, and prune the bines, as
\par their ancestors did for generations before them, Thus there is
\par actually no intelligence left in the country. The whole energy,
\par and knowledge, and resource of the land are barreled up in the
\par towns. You leave one city, and in many cases you will not meet
\par an educated or cultivated individual until you arrive at another;
\par all between is utter intellectual barrenness.
\par To what end now is this constant abstraction of able men
\par from rural districtsY To the end that there may be enough
\par functionaries to achieve those many desiderata which French
\par Governments have thought ought to be achieved-to provide
\par amusements, to manage mines, to construct roads and
\par bridges, to erect numerous buildings ; to print books, encourage
\par the fine arts, control this trade, and inspect that manufacture;
\par to do all the hundred-and-one things which the
\par State does in France. That the army of officers needed for
\par this may be maintained, agriculture must go unofficered.
\par That certain social conveniences may be better secured, the
\par chief social necessity is neglected. The very basis of the
\par national life is sapped, to gain a few non-essential advantages.
\par Said we not truly, then, that until a requirement is
\par spontaneously fulfilled, it should not be fulfilled at all Y
\par VI.
\par And here indeed we may recognize the close kinship between
\par the fundamental fallacy involved in these State-meddlings
\par and the fallacy lately exploded by the free-trade
\par agitation. These various law-made instrumentalities for
\par effecting ends which might otherwise not yet be effected, all
\par embody a subtler form of the protectionist hypothesis. The
\par same short-sightedness which, looking at commerce, pre160

\par scribed bounties and restrictions, looking at social affairs in
\par general, prescribes these multiplied administrations; and the
\par same criticism applies alike to all its proceedings.
\par For was not the error that vitiated every law aiming at
\par the artificial maintenance of a trade, substantially that which
\par we have just been dwelling upon; namely, this overlooking
\par of the fact that, in setting people to do one thing, some other
\par thing is inevitably left undone? The statesmen who thought
\par it wise to protect home-made silks against French silks, did
\par so under the impression that the manufacture thus secured
\par constituted a pure gain to the nation. They did not reflect
\par that the men employed in this manufacture would otherwise
\par have heen producing something else; a something else which,
\par as they could produce it without legal help, they could more
\par profitably produce. Landlords who have been so anxious to
\par prevent foreign wheat from displacing their own wheat, have
\par never duly realized the fact that if their fields would not
\par yield wheat so economically as to prevent the feared displacement,
\par it simply proved that they were growing unfit
\par crops in place of fit crops; and so working their land at a
\par relative loss. In all cases where, by restrictive duties, a
\par trade has been upheld that would otherwise not have existed,
\par capital has been turned into a channel less productive than
\par some other into which it would naturally have flowed. And
\par so, to pursue certain State-patronized occupations, men have
\par been drawn from more advantageous occupations.
\par Clearly then, as above alleged, the same oversight runs
\par through all these interferences; be they with commerce, or
\par be they with other things. In employing people to achieve
\par this or that desideratum, legislators have not perceived that
\par they were thereby preventing the \'b7achievement of some other
\par desideratum. They have habitually assumed that each proposed.
\par good would, if secured, be a pure good, instead of
\par being a good purchasable only by submission to some evil
\par which would else have been remedied; and, making this
\par error, have injuriously diverted men '8 labor. As in trade,
\par OVER-LEGISLA.TION. 161
\par so in other things, labor will spontaneously find out, better
\par than any government can find out for it, the things on which
\par it may best expend itself. Rightly regarded, the two propositions
\par are identical. This division into commercial and noncommercial
\par affairs is quite a superficial one. All the actions
\par going on in society come under the generalization: human
\par effort ministering to human desire. Whether the ministration
\par be effected through a process of buying and selling, or
\par whether in any other way, matters not so far as t~e general
\par law of it is concerned. In all cases it must be true that the
\par stronger desires will get themselves satisfied before the
\par weaker ones; and in all cases it must be true that to get satisfaction
\par for the weaker ones before they would naturally
\par have it, is to deny satisfaction to the stronger ones.
\par VII.
\par To the immense positive evils entailed by over-legislation
\par have to be added the equally great negative evils; evils
\par which, notwithstanding their greatness, are scarcely at all
\par recognized, even by the far-seeing. While the State does
\par those things which it ought not to do, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 as an inevitable consequence,
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 it leaves undone those things which it ought to do.
\par Time and activity being limited, it necessarily follows that
\par legislators' sins of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 commission }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 entail sins of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487

\par In the very nature of things an agency employed for two

\par because its adaptation to both ends implies incomplete fitness
\par for either. As has been well said }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 apropos }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of this point, "A

\par entails on us! How many are the grievances men bear, from
\par which they would otherwise be free! Who is there that has
\par not submitted to injuries rather than run the risk of heavy
\par law-costs 1 Who is there that has not ahandoned just claims
\par rather than "throw good\'b7 money after bad"? Who is there
\par that has not paid unjust demands rather than withstand the
\par threat of an action 1 This man can point to property that
\par has been alienated from his family from lack \'b7of funds or
\par courage to fight for it. That man can name several relations
\par ruined by alaw-suit. Here is a lawyer who has grown rich
\par on the hard earnings of the needy and the savings of the
\par oppressed. There is a once-wealthy trader who has been
\par brought by legal iniquities to the workhouse or the lunatic
\par asylum. The badness of our judicial system vitiates our
\par whole social life: renders almost every family poorer than
\par it would otherwise be; hampers almost every busines8 transaction;
\par inflicts daily anxieties on every trader. And all this
\par loss of property, time, temper, comfort, men quietly submit
\par to from being absorbed in the pursuit of schemes which eventually
\par bring on them other mischiefs.
\par Nay, the case is even worse. It is distinctly provable
\par that many of these evils about which outcries are raised, and
\par to cure which special Acts of Parliament are loudly invoked,

\par thus brought about; and would never have existed but for
\par the infamous corruptions of la\\v. Again, it has been shown
\par that the long-drawn miseries of Ireland, which have been
\par the subject of endless legislation, have been mainly produced
\par by inequitable land-tenure and the complicated system of

\par Judicial negligence, too, is the main cause of railwayaccidents.
\par If the State would fulfil its true function, by
\par giving passengers an easy remedy for breach of contract
\par when trains are behind time, it would do more to prevent
\par accidents than can be done by the minutest inspection or
\par the most cunningly-devised regulations; for it is notorious
\par that the majority of accidents are primarily caused by irregularity.
\par In the case of bad house-building, also, it is
\par obvious that a cheap, rigorous, and certain administration
\par of justice, would make Building Acts needless. For is not
\par the man who erects a house of bad materials ill put together,
\par and, concealing these with papering and plaster, sells it as
\par a substantial dwelling, guilty of fraud? And should not
\par the law recognize this fraud as it does in the analogous case

\par So is it in other cases; the evils which men perpetually call

\par from non-performance of its original duty.
\par See then how this vicious policy complicates itself. Not

\par through; and finds confirmation for this belief in the fact
\par that a great proportion of the most successful men are selfmade.
\par Well, is it not obvious that this relationship between

\par a capa.city for self-help must in every case have been brought
\par into existence by the practice of self-help; and, other things
\par equal, a lack of this capacity must in every case have arisen
\par from the lack of demand for it. Do not these two antecedents
\par and their two consequents agree with the facts as

\par teaches has its limits. The experiences which teach
\par must be experiences which can be appreciated; and experiences
\par exceeding a certain degree of complexity become inappreciable
\par to the majority. It is thus with most social
\par phenomena. If we remember that for these two thousand
\par years and more, mankind have been making regulations for
\par commerce, which have all along been strangling some trades
\par and killing others with kindness, and that though the proofs
\par of this have been constantly before their eyes, they have only
\par just discovered that they have been uniformly doing mischief;
\par if we remember that even now only a small portion
\par of them see this; we are taught that perpetually-repeated
\par and ever-accumulating experiences will fail to teach, until
\par there ,exist the mental conditions' required for the assimilation
\par of them. Nay, when they are assimilated, it is very imperfectly.
\par The truth they teach is only half understood,
\par even by those supposed to understand it best. For example,
\par Sir Rohert Peel, in one of his last speeches, after describing
\par the immensely increased consumption consequent on free
\par trade, goes on to say:
\par If, then, you can only continu.e that consumption; if, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 by your

\par in legislation in general, which should, by this experience,
\par have been greatly shaken, seemingly remains as strong as
\par ever. Here, again, is the House of Lords, apparently not
\par yet believing in the relationship of supply and demand,
\par adopting within these few weeks the standing order-
\par That before the first reading of any bill for making any work
\par in the construction of which compulsory power is sought to take
\par thirty houses or more, inhabited by the labouring classes in any
\par one parish or place, the promoters be required to deposit in the

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 If, then, in the comparatively simple relationships of
\par trade, the teachings of experience remain for so many ages

\par are perceived, it is scarcely to be hoped that where all social
\par phenomena--moral, intellectual, and physical-are involved,
\par any due appreciation of the truths displayed will presently
\par take place. The facts cannot yet get recognized as facts. As
\par the alchemist attributed his successive disappointments to

\par caused by this trifling oversight, or that little mistake: all
\par which oversights and mistakes he assures you will in future
\par be avoided. Eluding the facts as he does after this fashion,
\par volley after volley of them produce no effect.
\par Indeed this faith in governments is in a certain sense
\par organic; and can diminish only by being outgrown. From
\par the time when rulers were thought demi-gods, there has been
\par a gradual decline in men's estimates of their power. This
\par decline is still in progress, and has still far to go. Doubtless,

\par though not to the degree that at first appears. Only in

\par growth of other errors of the same genus. All superstitions
\par die hard; and we fear that this belief in government-omnipotenee
\par will form no exception.
\par THE GREAT POLITICAL SUPERSTITION.
\par THE great political superstition of the past was the divine
\par right of kings. The great political superstition of the present
\par is the divine rig-ht of parliaments. The oil of anointing seems
\par unawares to have dripped from the head of the one on to the
\par heads of the many, and given sacredness to them also and to
\par their decrees.
\par However irrational we may think the earlier of these beliefs,
\par we must admit that it was more consistent than is the
\par latter. Whether we go back to times when the king was a
\par god) or to times ~Then he was a descendant of a god, or to
\par times when he was god-appointed, we see good reason for
\par passjve obedience to his will. When, as undeI Louis XIV.,
\par theologians like Bossuet taught that kings "are gods, and
\par share in a manner the Divine independence," or when it
\par was thought, as by our o,vn Tory party in old days, that" the
\par monarch was the delegate of heaven;" it is clear that, given
\par the premise, the inevitable conclusion was that no bounds
\par could. be set to governmental commands But for the modern
\par belief such a warrant does not exist Making no pretention
\par to divine descent or divine appointment, a legislative body
\par can show no supernatural justification for its claim to un~
\par limited authority; and no natural justification has ever been
\par attempted. Hence, belief in its unlimited authority is with..
\par out that consistency which of old characterized belief in a
\par king's unlimited authority.
\par It is curious how commonly men continue to hold in fact,
\par THE GREAT POLITICAL SUPERSTITION. 175
\par doctrines which they have rejected in name-retaining the
\par substance after they have abandoned the form. In Theology
\par an illustration is snpplied by Carlyle, who, in his student days,
\par giving up, as he thought, the creed of his fathers, rejected its
\par shell only, keeping the contents; and was proved by his conceptions
\par of the world, and luan, and conduct, to be still among
\par the sternest of Scotch Calvinists. Similarly, Science\'a3urnishes
\par an instance in one who united naturalism in Geology with
\par supernaturalism in Biology-Sir Oharles Lyell. While, as
\par the leading expositor of the uniformitarian theory in Geology,
\par he ignored only the Mosaic cosmogony, he long defended that
\par belief in special creations of organic types, for which no other
\par source than the Mosaic cosmogony could be assigned; and
\par only in the latter part of his life surrendered to the arguments
\par of Mr. Darwin. In Politics, as above implied, we have an
\par analogous case. The tacitly-asserted doctrine, COlumon to
\par Tories, Whigs, and Radicals, that governmental authority is
\par unlimited, dates back to times when the law-giver was supposed
\par to have a warrant from God; and it survives still,
\par though the belief that the law-giver has God's warrant has
\par died out. "Oh, an Act of Parliament can do anything," is
\par the reply made to a citizen who questions the legitimacy of
\par some arbitrary State-interference; and the citizen stands
\par paralyzed. It does not occur to him to ask the how, and the
\par when, and the whence, of this asserted omnipotence bounded
\par only by physical impossibilities.
\par Here we will take leave to question it. In default of the
\par justification, once logically valid, that the ruler on Earth being
\par a deputy of the ruler in Heaven, submission to him in all
\par things is a duty, let us ask what reason there is for asserting
\par the duty of submission in all things to a ruling power, constitutional
\par or republican, which has no Heavenly-derived supremacy_
\par Evidently this inquiry commits us to a criticism
\par of past and present theories concerning political authority.

\par The notion of sovereignty is that which first presents

\par by those who do not assume the supernatural

\par Hobbes.
\par Let us grant Hobbes's postulate that, "during the time

\par they are in that condition ,vhich is called war . . . . of every

\par are some small uncivilized societies in which, without any
\par "common power to keep them all in awe," men maintain
\par peace and harmony better than it is maintained in societies
\par where such a power exists. Let us suppose him to be right,
\par too, in assuluing that the rise of a ruling man over associated
\par men, results fronl their desires to preserve order among
\par themselves; though, in fact, it habitually arises from the
\par need }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 for }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 subordination to a leader in war, defensive or

\par relation to the preservation of order among the combined
\par individuals. Once more, let us admit the indefensible assumption
\par that to escape the evils of chronic conflicts, which
\par must otherwise continue among them, the members of a
\par cOlnmunity enter into a "pact or covenant," by which they
\par all bind themselves to surrender their primitive freedom of
\par action, and subordinate themselves to the will of an autocrat
\par agreed upon: t accepting, also, the implication that their
\par descendants for ever are bound by the covenant which re~

\par that this unwarranted assumption vitiates Hobbes's argument

\par we have to observe two significant implications. One
\par is that State-authority as thus derived, is a means to an end,
\par and has no validity save as subserving that end: if the end

\par "But surely," will come in deafening chorus the reply,
\par "there is the unquestionable right of the majority, which
\par gives unquestionable right to the parliament it elects."
\par Yes, now we are coming down to the root ot -the lllatter.
\par The divine right of parliaments means the divine right of
\par majorities. The fundamental assumption made by legislators
\par and people alike, is that a majority has powers which have
\par no bounds. This is the current theory which all accept
\par without proof as a self.evident truth. Nevertheless, criticism
\par will, I think, show that this current theory requires a radical
\par modification.
\par In an essay on "Railway Morals and Railway Policy,"
\par published in the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Edvnburgh Re1)iew }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 for October, 1854, I had
\par occasion to deal vvith the question of a majority's powers as
\par exemplified in the conduct of public companies; and I cannot
\par better prepare the way for conclusions presently to be dra,vn,
\par than by quoting a passage from it :-
\par "Under whatever circumstances, or for whatever ends, a number of
\par men co-operate, it is held that if difference of opinion arises among
\par them, justice requires that the will of' the greater number shall be executed
\par rather than that of the smaller number; and this rule is supposed
\par to be uniformly applicable, be the question at issue what it may.
\par So confirmed is this conviction, and so little have the ethics of the
\par matter been considered, that to most this mere suggestion of a doubt
\par will cause some astonishment. Yet it needs but a brief analysis to
\par show that the opinion is little better than a political superstition.
\par Instances may readily be selected which prove, by }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 reductio ad ab8urdum,
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 that the right of a majority is a purely conditional right, valid only
\par within specific limits. Let us take a few. Suppose that at the general
\par meeting of some philanthropic association, it was resolved that in addition
\par to relieving distress the association should employ home-mission~
\par aries to preach down popery. Might the subscriptions of Catholics,
\par who had joined the body with charitable views, be rightfully used for

\par more important than reading, should decide to change the purpose of
\par their union, and to apply the funds in hand for the purchase of powder,
\par ball, and targets. Would the rest be bound by this decision ~ Suppose
\par that under the excitement of news from Australia, the majority of a
\par Freehold Land Society should determine, not simply to start in a body
\par for the gold-diggings, but to use their accumulated capital to provide
\par outfits.Would this appropriation of property be just to the minority ~
\par and must these join the expedition1 Scarcely anyone would venture
\par an affirmative answer even to the first of these questions; much less to
\par the others. And why? Because everyone must perceive that by uniting
\par himself with others, no man can equitably be betrayed into acts
\par utterly foreign to the purpose for which he joined them. Each of these
\par supposed minorities would properly reply to those seeking to coerce
\par them :-'We combined with you for a defined object; we gave money
\par and time for the furtherance of that object; on all questions thence
\par arising we tacitly agreed to conform to the will of the greater
\par number; but we did not agree to conform on any other questions.
\par If you induce us to join you by professing a certain end, and then
\par undertake some other end of which we were not apprised, you obtain
\par our support under false pretences; you exceed the expressed or understood
\par compact to which we committed ourselves; and we are no longer
\par bound by your decisions.' Clearly this is the only rational interpretation
\par of the matter. The general principle underlying the right government
\par of every incorporated body, is, that its members contract with
\par one another severally to submit to the will of the majority in all
\par matters concerning the fulfilment of the objects for which they are incorporated;
\par but in no others. To this extent only can the contract
\par hold. For as it is implied in the very nature of a contract, that those
\par entering into it must know what they contract to do; and as those who
\par unite with others for a specified object, cannot contemplate all the un,
\par specified objects which it is hypothetically possible for the union to
\par undertake; it follows that the contract entered into cannot extend to
\par such unspecified objects. And if there exists no expressed or understood
\par contract between the union and its members respecting unspecified
\par objects, then for the majority to coerce the minority into undertaking
\par them, is nothing less than gross tyranny."
\par Naturally, if such a confusion of ideas exists in respect
\par of the powers of a majority where the deed of incorporation
\par tacitly limits those powers, still more must there exist such
\par a confusion where there has been no deed of incorporation.
\par Nevertheless the same principle holds. I again emphasize
\par THE GREAT POLITICAL SUPERSTITION. 181
\par the proposition that the members of an incorporated body
\par are bound" severally to sublnit to the will of the majority
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 in all matters concerning tl"e j:ulfilment if tILe objeotsfor

\par contend that this holds of an incorporated nation as much as
\par of an incorporated cOlnpany.
\par "Yes, but," comes the obviolls rejoinder, "9,S there is no
\par deed by which the members of a nation are incorporated-as
\par there neither is, nor ever was, a specification of purposes for
\par which the union was formed, there exist no limits; and, consequently,
\par the power of the majority is unlimited."
\par Evidently it\'b7 Inust be admitted that the hypothesis of a
\par social contract, either under the shape assulued by Hobbes
\par or under the shape assumed by Rousseau, is baseless. Nay
\par more, it must be admitted that even had such a contract once
\par been formed, it could not be binding on the posterity of those
\par who formed it. Moreover, if any say that in the absence of
\par those limitations to its powers which a deed of incorporation
\par might imply, there is nothing to prevent a majority from
\par imposing its will on a minority b,Y force, assent must be given
\par -an assent, however, joined with the comment that if the

\par also .justified ; the problem lapses. What we here seek is
\par sonle higher warrant for the subordination of minority to
\par majority than that arising from inability to resist physical
\par coercion. Even Austin, anxious as he is to establish the unquestionable
\par authority of positive law, and assuming, as he
\par does, an absolute sovereignty of some kind, monarchic, aristocratic,
\par constitutional, or popular, as the source of its unquestionable
\par authority, is obliged, in the last resort, to admit a
\par moral limit to its action over the community. While insisting,
\par in pursuance }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 his rigid theory of sovereignty, that a

\par it leaves or grants to its subjects." * Hence, we have to find,
\par not a physical justification, but a moral justification, for the
\par supposed absolute power of the majority.
\par This will at once draw forth the rejoinder-" Of course,
\par in the absence of any agreement, with its irnplied limitations,
\par the rule of the majority is unlimited; because it is more just
\par that the majority should have its way than that the minority
\par should have its way." A very reasonable rejoinder this seems
\par until there comes the re-rejoinder. We may oppose to it the
\par equally tenable proposition that, in the absence of an agreement,
\par the supremacy of a majority over a minority does not
\par exist at all. It is co-operation of SOlne kind, from which
\par there arises these powers and obligations of majority and
\par minority; and in the absence of any agreement to co-operate,
\par such powers and obligations are also absent.
\par Here the argunlent apparently ends in a dead lock.
\par Under the existing condition of things, no moral origin seems
\par assignable, either for the sovereignty of the majority or for
\par the limitation of its sovereignty. But further consideration
\par reveals a solution of the difficulty. For if, dismissing all
\par thought of any hypothetical agreelnent to co-operate heretofore
\par made, we ask what would be the agreement into which
\par citizens would now enter with practical unanimity, we get a
\par sufficiently clear answer; and with it a sufficiently clear
\par justification for the rule of the majority inside a certain
\par sphere but not outside that sphere. Let us first observe a
\par few of the limitations which at once become apparent.
\par Were all Englishmen now asked if they would agree to
\par co-operate for the teaching of religion, and would give the

\par would refuse. In like manner if (to take an actual question
\par of the day) people were polled to ascertain whether, in
\par respect of the beverages they drank, they would accept the

\par more than half, would be unwilling. Similarly with respe~t

\par idea that there are any such things in social matters as

\par An author has no natural right to a l)roperty in his production.

\par counter-proposition affirmed. Let us see what it is; and
\par what results when we go behind it and seek its warrant.
\par On reverting to Bentham, we find this counter-proposition
\par openly expressed. He tells us that government fulfils its
\par office" by creating rights which it confers upon individuals:
\par rights of personal security; rights of protection for honour;
\par rights of property;" &c.* Were this doctrine asserted as
\par following from the divine right of kings, there would be
\par nothing in it nlanifestly incongruous. Did it come to us
\par from ancient Peru, where the Ynca "was the source from
\par which everything flowed; " t or from Shoa (Abyssinia), where
\par "of their persons and worldly substance he [the King] is
\par absolute master;" 4: or from Dahome, where" all men are
\par slaves to the king;" # it would be consistent enough. But
\par Bentham, far from being an absolutist like Hobbes, wrote in
\par the interests of popular rule. In his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Oonstitutional Oode }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 II
\par he fixes the sovereignty in the whole people; arguing that

\par portion of those whose greatest happiness is the proper and
\par chosen object," because "this proportion is more apt than
\par any other that can be proposed" for achievement of that
\par object.
\par Mark, now, what happens when we put these two doctrines
\par together. The sovereign people jointly appoint representatives,
\par and so create a government; the government thus
\par created, creates rights; and then, having created rights, it
\par confers them on the separate members of the sovereign people
\par by which it was itself created. Here is a marvellous

\par phantoms the most shadowy is this which supposes a thing
\par to be obtained by creating an agent, which creates the thing,
\par and then confers the thing on its own creator !
\par From whatever point of vie"'iiV we consider it,. Bentham's
\par proposition proves to be unthinkable. Government, he says,
\par :tul:6.lsits office " by creating rights." Two meanings may be
\par given to the word" creating." It may be supposed to mean
\par the production of sornething out of nothing; or it may be
\par supposed to mean the giving forIn and structure to something
\par which already exists. There are many who think that
\par the production of something out of nothing cannot be conceived
\par as effected even by omnipotence; and probably none
\par will assert that the production of something out of nothing
\par is within the competence of a human government. The alternative
\par conception is that a human government creates only
\par in the sense that it shapes something pre-existing. In that
\par case, the question arises-" What is the something pre-existing
\par which it. shapes ~ " Clearly the word "creating" begs
\par the whole question-passes off an illusion on the unwary
\par reader. Bentham was a stickler for definiteness of expression,
\par and in his }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Book of Fallacies }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 has a chapter on "Impostor-
\par terms." It is curious that he should have furnished so
\par striking an illustration of the perverted belief which an impostor-
\par term may generate.
\par But now let us overlook these various impossibilities of
\par thought, and seek the most defensible interpretation of Bentham's
\par vie}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 'v.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 It may be said that the totality of all powers and rights,
\par originally exists as an undivided whole in the sovereign peopIe;
\par and that this undivided whole is given in trust (as Austin
\par would say) to a ruling power, appointed by the sovereign
\par people, for the purpose of distribution. If,as we have seen,
\par the proposition that rights are created is simply a figure of
\par speech; then the only intelligible construction of Bentham's
\par view is that a multitude }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 individuals, who severally wish to

\par satisfy their desires, and have, as an aggregate, possession of
\par all the sources of satisfaction, as well as power over all individual
\par actions, appoint a govel'nment, which declares the
\par ways in which, and the conditions under which, individual
\par actions may be carried on and the satisfactions obtained.
\par Let us observe the implications. Each man exists in two
\par capacities. In his private capacity he is subject to the government.
\par In his public capacity he is one of the sovereign
\par people who appoint the government. That is to say, in his
\par private capacity he is one of those to whom rights are given;
\par and in his public capacity he is one of those who, through
\par the government they appoint, give the rights. Turn this
\par abstract statement into a concrete statement, and see what it
\par means. Let the community consist of a million men, who,
\par by the hypothesis, are not only joint possessors of the in~
\par habited region, but joint possessors of all liberties of action
\par and appropriation: the only right recognized being that of
\par the aggregate to everything. What follows ~ Each person,
\par while not owning any product of his own labour, has, as a
\par unit in the sovereign body, a millionth part of the ownership
\par of the products of all others' labour. This is an unavoidable
\par implication. As the government, in Bentham's view, is but

\par where we may, we find that governments interdict the same

\par kinds of claims. They habitually forbid homicide, theft,
\par adultery: thus asserting that citizens may not be trespassed

\par Not even yet have we noted all the classes of facts which
\par tell the same story. It is told afresh in the improvements
\par and reforms of law itself; as well as in the admissions and

\par Common-law, or rectify its inequities, proceeded throughout
\par on a recognition of men's claims considered as existing apart

\par to time made after resistance, are similarly made in pursuance
\par of current ideas concerning the requirements of justice;
\par ideas which, instead of being derived from the law, are
\par opposed to the law. For example, that recent Act which

\par rights, and including, as they do, a great deal which should
\par be excluded, yet they shadow forth a truth.
\par It remains now to consider the original source of this
\par truth. In a previous paper I have spoken of the open secret,
\par that there can be no social phenomena but what, if we analyze
\par them to the bottom, bring us down to the laws of life; and
\par that there can be no true understanding of them without reference
\par to the laws of life. Let us, then, transfer this question
\par of natural rights from the court of politics to the court
\par of science-the science of life. The reader need feel no alarm:
\par the simplest and most obvious facts will suffice. We ,vill contemplate
\par first the general conditions to individual life; and
\par then the general conditions to social life. We shall find that
\par both yield the same verdict.
\par Animal life involves waste; waste must be met by repair;
\par repair implies nutrition. Again, nutrition presupposes obtainment
\par of food; food cannot be got without powers of prehension,
\par and, usually, of locomotion; and that these powers
\par may achieve their ends, there must be freedom to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 move
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 about. If you shut up a mamlual in a small space, or tie its
\par limbs together, or take from it the food it has procured, you
\par eventually, by persistence in one or other of these courses,
\par cause its death. Passing a certain point, hindrance to the
\par fulfilment of these requirements is fatal. And all this, which
\par holds of the higher animals at large, of course holds of man.
\par If we adopt pessimism as a creed, and with it accept the
\par implication that life in general being an evil should be put
\par an end to, then there is no ethical warrant for these actions
\par by which life is maintained: the whole question drops. But
\par if we adopt either the optimist view or the meliorist view-if
\par we say that life on the whole yields more pleasure than pain;
\par or that it is on the way to beconle such that it will yield more
\par pleasure than pain; then these actions by which life is maintained
\par are justified, and there results a warrant for the freedom
\par to perform them. Those who hold that life is valuable.,/

\par hold, by implication, that men ought not to be prevented from
\par carrying on life-sustaining activities. In other words, if it is
\par said to be "right" that they should carry them on, then, by
\par permutation, we get the assertion that they "have a right"
\par to carry them on. Clearly the conception of " natural rights"
\par originates in recognition of the truth that if life is justifiable,
\par there must be a justification for the performance of acts essential
\par to its preservation; and, therefore, a justification for
\par those liberties and claims which make such acts possible.
\par But being true of other creatures as of man, this is a
\par proposition lacking ethical character. Ethical character arises
\par only with the distinction between what the individual }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 may }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 do

\par not }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 do. This distinction obviously results from the presence
\par of his fellows. Among those who are in close proximity, or
\par even some distance apart, the doings of each are apt to interfere
\par with the doings of others; and in the absence of proof
\par that some may do what they will without limit, while others
\par may not, mutual limitation is necessitated. The non-ethical
\par form of the right to pursue ends, passes into the ethical form,
\par when there is recognized the difference between acts which
\par can be perforlned without transgressing the limits, and others
\par which cannot be so performed.
\par This, which is the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 a priori }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 conclusion, is the conclusion

\par Of the ungoverned tribes of ''Tasmania, we are told that
\par "their hunting grounds were all determined, and trespassers
\par were liable to attack." * And, m,anifestly, the quarrels caused
\par among tribes by intrusions on one another's territories, tend,
\par in the long run, to fix bounds and to give a certain sanction
\par to them. As with each inhabited area, so with each inhabitlug
\par group. A death in one, rightly or wrongly t1~~l'ib~d to
\par somebody in another, prompts" the sacred duty of bloodrevenge;"
\par and though retaliations are thus made chronic,

\par units; and during which each family or clan had to

\par the community may safely do and what he may not safely do,

\par When we turn from the life of the individual to the life
\par of the society, the same lesson is taught us.

\par men to live in groups, yet the chief prompter is experience
\par of the advantages to be derived from co-operation. On what
\par condition only can co-operation arise ~ Evidently on condition
\par that those who join their efforts severally gain by
\par doing so. If, as in the simplest cases, they unite to achieve
\par something which each by himself cannot achieve, or can
\par achieve less readily, it must be on the tacit understanding,
\par either that they shall share the benefit (as when game is
\par caught by a party of them), or that if one reaps all the bene..
\par fit now (as in building a hut or clearing a plot), the others
\par shall severally reap equivalent benefits in their turns. When,
\par instead of efforts joined in doing the same thing, different
\par things are effected by them-when division of labour arises,
\par with accompanying barter of products, the arrangement
\par implies that each, in return for something which he has in
\par superfluous quantity, gets an approximate equivalent of
\par something which he wants. If he hands over the one and
\par does not get the other, future proposals to exchange will
\par meet with no response. There will be a reversion to that
\par rudest condition in which each lllakes everything for himself.
\par Hence the possibility of co-operation depends on fulfilment
\par of contract, tacit or overt.
\par Now this which we see must hold of the very first step
\par towards that industrial organization by which the life of a
\par society is maintained, must hold more or less fully throughout
\par its development. Though the militant type of organization,
\par with its system of 8tat1.t~' produced by chronic war,
\par greatly obscures these relations of contracts, yet they remain
\par partially in force. They still hold between freemen, and
\par between the heads of those sIIlall groups which form the

\par units of early societies; and, in a measure, they still hold
\par within these small groups themselves; since survival of
\par them as groups, implies such recognition of the claims of
\par their members, even when slaves, that in return for\'b7 their
\par labours they get sufficiencies of food, clothing, and protection.
\par And when, with diminution of warfare.and growth of\'b7trade,
\par voluntary co-operation more and Dlore replaces compulsory
\par co-operation, and the carrying on of social life by exchange
\par under agreement, partially suspended for a thne, gradually
\par re-establishes itself; its re-establishment makes possible that
\par vast elaborate industrial organization by which a great nation
\par is sustained.
\par For in proportion as contracts are unhindered and the performance
\par of them certain, the growth is great and the social
\par life active. It is not now by one or other of two individuals
\par who contract, that the evil effects of breach of contract are
\par experienced. In an advanced society, they are experienced
\par by entire classes of producers and distributors, which have
\par arisen through division of labor; and, eventually, they are
\par experienced by everybody. Ask on what condition it is that
\par Birlningham devotes itself to manufacturing hardware, or
\par part of Staffordshire to making pottery, or Lancashire to
\par weaving cotton. A.sk how the rural people who here grow
\par wheat and there pasture cattle, find it possible to occupy
\par themselves in their special businesses. These groups can
\par severally thus act only if each gets from the others in
\par exchange for its own surplus product, due shares of their
\par surplus products. No longer directly effected by barter, this
\par obtainment of their respective shares of one another's prod..
\par ucts is indirectly effected by money; and if we ask how
\par each division of producers gets its due amount of the required
\par money, the answer is-by fulfilment of contract. If Leeds
\par makes woollens and does not, by fulfilment of contract,
\par receive the means of obtaining from agricultural districts the
\par needful quantity of food, it must starve, and stop producing
\par woollens. If South Wales smelts iron and there comes no

\par equivalent agreed upon, enabling it to get fabrics for clothing,
\par its industry must cease. And so throughout, in general and
\par in detail. That mutual dependence of parts which we see in
\par social organization, as in individual organization, is possible
\par only on condition that while each other part does the particular
\par kind of work it has become adjusted to, it receives its
\par proportion of those materials required for repair and growth,
\par which all the other parts have joined to produce: such proportion
\par being settled by bargaining. Moreover, it is by fulfihnent
\par of contract that there is effected a baJancing of all
\par the various products to the various needs-the large manufacture
\par of knives and the small manufacture of lancets; the
\par great growth of wheat and the little growth of mustard-seed.
\par The check on undue production of each commodity, results
\par from finding that, after a certain quantity, no one will agree
\par to take any further quantity on terrns that yield an adequate
\par money equivalent. And so there is prevented a useless
\par expenditure of labour in producing that which society does
\par not want.
\par Lastly, we have to note the still more significant fact that
\par the condition under which only, any specialized group of
\par workers can grow when the community needs more of its
\par particular kind of work, is that contracts shall be free and
\par fulfilrnent of them enforced. If when, :from lack of material,
\par Lancashire failed to supply' the usual quantity of cottongoods,
\par there had been such interference with the contracts as
\par prevented Yorkshire from asking a greater price for its
\par woollens, which it was enabled to do by the greater demand
\par for them, there would have been no temptation to put more
\par ~apital into the woollen manufacture, no increase in the
\par amount of machinery and number of artisans employed, and
\par no Increase of woollens: the consequence being that the
\par whole community would have suffered from not having
\par deficient cottons replaced by extra woollens. What serious
\par injury may result to a nation if its melnbers are hindered
\par fronl contracting with one another, was well shown in the

\par Here, though obstacles were at first raised by classes pre~

\par prevented capitalists from investing, engineers from furnishing

\par received by engineers, led to that drafting of money, energy,
\par and ability, into railway-lnaking, which rapidly developed
\par our railway-system, to the enormous increase of our national

\par Before turning to those corollaries which have practical
\par applications, let .us observe how the special conclusions
\par drawn converge to the one general conclusion originally

\par We have just found that the pre-requisite to individual

\par this aggregate impersonal life rises or falls according as the

\par Study of men's politico-ethical ideas and sentiments, leads
\par to allied conclusions. Primitbre peoples of various types
\par show us that before governments exist, immemorial customs
\par recognize private claims and justify maintenance of them.
\par Codes of law independently evolved by different nations,
\par agree in forbidding certain trespasses on the persons, properties,

\par natural source. Along with social development, the formulating
\par in law of the rights pre-established by custoln) becomes
\par more definite and elaborate. At the same time, Government
\par undertakes to an increasing. extent the business of enforcing
\par them. While it\'b7 has been becoming a better protector,
\par Government has been becolning less aggressive-has more
\par and more diminished its intrusions on men's spheres of
\par private action. And, lastly, as in past titnes laws were
\par avowedly modified to fit better with current ideas of equity;
\par so now, law-reformers are guided by ideas of equity which
\par are not derived froln law but to which law has to conform.
\par Here, then, we have a politico-ethical theory justified alike
\par by analysis and by history. What have we against it 1 A
\par fashionable counter-theory, purely dogmatic, which proves to
\par be unjustifiable. On the one hand, while we find that individual
\par life and social life both imply maintenance of the
\par natural relation between efforts and benefits; we\'b7 also find
\par that this natural relation, recognized before Governnlent
\par existed, has been all along asserting and re-asserting itself,
\par and obtaining better recognition in codes of law and systems
\par of ethics. On the other hand, those who, denying natural
\par rights, commit themselves to the assertion that rights are artificially
\par created by law, are not only flatly contradicted by
\par facts, but their assertion is self-destructive: the endeavour
\par to substantiate it, when challenged, involves them in manifold
\par absurdities.
\par Nor is this all. The re-institution of a vague popular conception
\par in a definite form on a scientific basis, leads us to a
\par rational view of the relation between the wills of majorities
\par and minorities. It turns out that those co-operations in
\par which all can voluntarily unite, and in the carrying on of
\par which the will of the majority is rightly supreme, are cooperations
\par for maintaining the conditions requisite to individual
\par and social life. Defence of the society as a whole
\par against external invaders, has for its remote end to preserve
\par each citizen in possession of such means as he has for satisfy..
\par THE GREAT POLITICAL SUPERSTITION. 205
\par ing his desires, and in possession of such liberty ashe has for
\par getting further means. And defence of each citizen against
\par internal invaders, from murderers down to those who inflict
\par nuisances on their neighbours, has obviously the like endan
\par end desired by every oue save the criminal and disorderly.
\par Hence it follows that for lllaintenance of this vital principle,
\par alike of individual life and s~oci9.1 life, subordination of
\par minority to lnajority is legitima~te; as iInplying only such a
\par trenching on the freedolll and property of each, as is requisite
\par for the better protecting of his freedorn and property. At
\par the same time it follows that such subordination is not legitimate
\par beyond this; since, implying as it does a greater aggression
\par upon the individual than is requisite for protecting him,
\par it involves a breach of the vital principle which is to be
\par maintained.
\par Thus we come round again to the proposition that the
\par assumed divine right of parliaruents, and the implied divi.ne
\par right of majorities, are superstitions. While men have
\par abandoned the old theory respecting the source }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 Stateauthority,
\par they have retained a belief in that unlirnited extent
\par of State-authority which rightly accompanied the old
\par . theory, but does not rightly accompany the new one. Unrestricted
\par power over subjects, rationally ascribed to the ruling
\par man when he vtas held to be a deputy-god, is now ascribed
\par to the ruling body, the deputy-godhood of which nobody
\par asserts.
\par Opponents will, possibly, contend that discussions about
\par the origin and limits of governrnental authority are mere
\par pedantries. "Government," they may perhaps say, "is
\par bound to use all the means it has, or can get, lor furthering

\par range of their power." Is there really an escape here ~ or
\par may this opening be effectually closed ~
\par The essential question raised is the truth of the utilitarian
\par theory as commonly held; and the answer here to be given
\par is that, as comlllonly held, it is not true. Alike by the statements
\par of utilitarian moralists, and by the acts of politicians
\par knowingly or unknowingly following their lead, it is implied
\par that utility is to be directly deterlnined by simple inspection
\par of the immediate facts and estimation of probable results.
\par Whereas, utilitarianism as rightly understood, implies guidance
\par by the general conclusions which analysis of experience
\par yields. "Good and bad results cannot be accidental, but
\par Dlust be necessary consequences of the constitution of things;"
\par and it is "the business of Moral Science to deduce, from the
\par laws of life and the conditions of existence, what kinds of
\par action necessarily tend to produce happiness, and what kinds
\par to produce unhappiness." * Current utilitarian speculation,
\par like current practical politics, shows inadequate conscious..
\par ness of natural\'b7 causation. The habitual thought is that, in
\par the absence of some obvious impediment, things can be done
\par this way or that way; and no question is put whether there
\par is either agreement or conflict with the normal working of
\par things.
\par The foregoing discussions have, I think, shown that the
\par dictates of utility, and, consequently, the proper actions of
\par governnlents, are not to be settled by inspection of facts on
\par the surface, and acceptance of their }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\insrsid332487\charrsid332487 prima facie }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af31507 \ltrch\fcs0 \insrsid332487\charrsid332487 meanings;
\par but are to be settled by reference to, and deductions from,
\par fundanIental facts. The fundamental facts to which all
\par rational judgments of utility must go back, are the facts that
\par life consists in, and is maintained by, certain activities; and
\par that among men in a society, these activities, necessarily

\par on the actions of particular classes of TIleh, and
\par ignored the effects produced by a Inultiplicity of such interferences
\par on the lives of men at large. And if we ask what
\par then made, and what no,v makes, this error possible, we find
\par it to be the political superstition that governmental power is
\par subject to no restraints.
\par When that" divinity" which" doth hedge a king," and
\par which has left a glamour around the body inheriting his
\par power, has quite died away-when it begins to be seen
\par clearly that, in a popularly governed nation, the government
\par is simply a committee of management; it 'will also be seen
\par THE GREAT POLITICAL SUPERSTITION. 209
\par that this committee of managelment has no intrinsic authority.
\par The inevitable conclusion will be that its authority is
\par given by those appointing it; and has just such bounds as
\par they choose to impose. Along with this will go the further
\par conclusion that the laws it passes are not in themselves sacred;
\par but that whatever sacredness they have, it is entirely
\par due to the ethical sanction-an. ethical sanction which, as we
\par find, is derivable from the lav\\Ts of human life as carried on
\par under social conditions. And there will come the corollary
\par that when they have not this ethical sanction they have no
\par sacredness, and may rightly be challenged.
\par The function of Liberalism in the past was that of putting
\par a linlit to the powers of kings. The function of true Liberalism
\par in the future will be that of putting a limit to the powers
\par of Parliaments.
