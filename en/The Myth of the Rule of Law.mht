Thank you. You may now read on.
<p>In his novel <i>1984</i>, George Orwell created a nightmare vision of
the future in which an all-powerful Party exerts totalitarian control over
society by forcing the citizens to master the technique of &quot;doublethin=
k,&quot;
which requires them &quot;to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancel[]
out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them.&quot;<=
sup><a href=3D"#N_3_">
(3)</a></sup> Orwell&#x27;s doublethink is usually regarded as a wonderful=
 literary
device, but, of course, one with no referent in reality since it is obvious=
ly
impossible to believe both halves of a contradiction. In my opinion, this
assessment is quite mistaken. Not only is it possible for people to believe
both halves of a contradiction, it is something they do every day with
no apparent difficulty.
</p><p>Consider, for example, people&#x27;s beliefs about the legal system.=
 They
are obviously aware that the law is inherently political. The common compla=
int
that members of Congress are corrupt, or are legislating for their own
political benefit or for that of special interest groups demonstrates that
citizens understand that the laws under which they live are a product of
political forces rather than the embodiment of the ideal of justice. Furthe=
r,
as evidenced by the political battles fought over the recent nominations
of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, the public obvious=
ly
believes that the ideology of the people who serve as judges influences
the way the law is interpreted.
</p><p>This, however, in no way prevents people from simultaneously regardi=
ng
the law as a body of definite, politically neutral rules amenable to an
impartial application which all citizens have a moral obligation to obey.
Thus, they seem both surprised and dismayed to learn that the Clean Air
Act might have been written, not to produce the cleanest air possible,
but to favor the economic interests of the miners of dirty-burning West
Virginia coal (West Virginia coincidentally being the home of Robert Byrd,
who was then chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee) over those
of the miners of cleaner-burning western coal.<sup><a href=3D"#N_4_"> (4)</=
a></sup>
And, when the Supreme Court hands down a controversial ruling on a subject
such as abortion, civil rights, or capital punishment, then, like Louis
in <i>Casablanca</i>, the public is shocked,
<i>shocked</i> to find that
the Court may have let political considerations influence its decision.
The frequent condemnation of the judiciary for &quot;undemocratic judicial=
 activism&quot;
or &quot;unprincipled social engineering&quot; is merely a reflection of th=
e public&#x27;s
belief that the law consists of a set of definite and consistent &quot;neut=
ral
principles&quot;<sup><a href=3D"#N_5_"> (5)</a></sup> which the judge is ob=
ligated
to apply in an objective manner, free from the influence of his or her
personal political and moral beliefs.
</p><p>I believe that, much as Orwell suggested, it is the public&#x27;s ab=
ility
to engage in this type of doublethink, to be aware that the law is inherent=
ly
political in character and yet believe it to be an objective embodiment
of justice, that accounts for the amazing degree to which the federal gover=
nment
is able to exert its control over a supposedly free people. I would argue
that this ability to maintain the belief that the law is a body of consiste=
nt,
politically neutral rules that can be objectively applied by judges in
the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, goes a long way toward
explaining citizens&#x27; acquiescence in the steady erosion of their funda=
mental
freedoms. To show that this is, in fact, the case, I would like to direct
your attention to the fiction which resides at the heart of this incongruity
and allows the public to engage in the requisite doublethink without cognit=
ive
discomfort: the myth of the rule of law.
</p><p>I refer to the <i>myth</i> of the rule of law because, to the extent
this phrase suggests a society in which all are governed by neutral rules
that are objectively applied by judges, there is no such thing. As a myth,
however, the concept of the rule of law is both powerful and dangerous.
Its power derives from its great emotive appeal. The rule of law suggests
an absence of arbitrariness, an absence of the worst abuses of tyranny.
The image presented by the slogan &quot;America is a government of laws and
not people&quot; is one of fair and impartial rule rather than subjugation=
 to
human whim. This is an image that can command both the allegiance and affec=
tion
of the citizenry. After all, who wouldn&#x27;t be in favor of the rule of=
 law
if the only alternative were arbitrary rule? But this image is also the
source of the myth&#x27;s danger. For if citizens really believe that they=
 are
being governed by fair and impartial rules and that the only alternative
is subjection to personal rule, they will be much more likely to support
the state as it progressively curtails their freedom.
</p><p>In this Article, I will argue that this is a false dichotomy. Specif=
ically,
I intend to establish three points: 1) there is no such thing as a governme=
nt
of law and not people, 2) the belief that there is serves to maintain public
support for society&#x27;s power structure, and 3) the establishment of a=
 truly
free society requires the abandonment of the myth of the rule of law.

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">II.
</p><p>Imagine the following scene. A first-year contracts course is being
taught at the prestigious Harvard Law School. The professor is a distinguis=
hed
scholar with a national reputation as one of the leading experts on Anglo-A=
merican
contract law. Let&#x27;s call him Professor Kingsfield. He instructs his cl=
ass
to research the following hypothetical for the next day.
</p><blockquote>A woman living in a rural setting becomes ill and calls her
family physician, who is also the only local doctor, for help. However,
it is Wednesday, the doctor&#x27;s day off and because she has a golf date,
she does not respond. The woman&#x27;s condition worsens and because no oth=
er
physician can be procured in time, she dies. Her estate then sues the doctor
for not coming to her aid. Is the doctor liable?</blockquote>
Two of the students, Arnie Becker and Ann Kelsey, resolve to make a good
impression on Kingsfield should they be called on to discuss the case.
Arnie is a somewhat conservative, considerably egocentric individual. He
believes that doctors are human beings, who like anyone else, are entitled
to a day off, and that it would be unfair to require them to be at the
beck and call of their patients. For this reason, his initial impression
of the solution to the hypothetical is that the doctor should not be liable.
Through his research, he discovers the case of <i>Hurley v. Eddingfield</i>=
,<sup><a href=3D"#N_6_">
(6)</a></sup> which establishes the rule that in the absence of an explicit
contract, i.e., when there has been no actual meeting of the minds, there
can be no liability. In the hypothetical, there was clearly no meeting
of the minds. Therefore, Arnie concludes that his initial impression was
correct and that the doctor is not legally liable. Since he has found a
valid rule of law which clearly applies to the facts of the case, he is
confident that he is prepared for tomorrow&#x27;s class.
<p>Ann Kelsey is politically liberal and considers herself to be a caring
individual. She believes that when doctors take the Hippocratic oath, they
accept a special obligation to care for the sick, and that it would be
wrong and set a terrible example for doctors to ignore the needs of regular
patients who depend on them. For this reason, her initial impression of
the solution to the hypothetical is that the doctor should be liable. Throu=
gh
her research, she discovers the case of <i>Cotnam v. Wisdom</i>,<sup><a hre=
f=3D"#N_7_">
(7)</a></sup> which establishes the rule that in the absence of an explicit
contract, the law will imply a contractual relationship where such is neces=
sary
to avoid injustice. She believes that under the facts of the hypothetical,
the failure to imply a contractual relationship would be obviously unjust.
Therefore, she concludes that her initial impression was correct and that
the doctor is legally liable. Since she has found a valid rule of law which
clearly applies to the facts of the case, she is confident that she is
prepared for tomorrow&#x27;s class.
</p><p>The following day, Arnie is called upon and presents his analysis.=
 Ann,
who knows she has found a sound legal argument for exactly the opposite
outcome, concludes that Arnie is a typical privileged white male conservati=
ve
with no sense of compassion, who has obviously missed the point of the
hypothetical. She volunteers, and when called upon by Kingsfield criticizes
Arnie&#x27;s analysis of the case and presents her own. Arnie, who knows he
has found a sound legal argument for his position, concludes that Ann is
a typical female bleeding-heart liberal, whose emotionalism has caused
her to miss the point of the hypothetical. Each expects Kingsfield to confi=
rm
his or her analysis and dismiss the other&#x27;s as the misguided bit of il=
logic
it so obviously is. Much to their chagrin, however, when a third student
asks, &quot;But who is right, Professor?,&quot; Kingsfield gruffly responds=
, &quot;When
you turn that mush between your ears into something useful and begin to
think like a lawyer, you will be able to answer that question for yourself&=
quot;
and moves on to another subject.
</p><p>What Professor Kingsfield knows but will never reveal to the students
is that both Arnie&#x27;s and Ann&#x27;s analyses are correct. How can this=
 be?

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">III.
</p><p>What Professor Kingsfield knows is that the legal world is not like
the real world and the type of reasoning appropriate to it is distinct
from that which human beings ordinarily employ. In the real world, people
usually attempt to solve problems by forming hypotheses and then testing
them against the facts as they know them. When the facts confirm the hypoth=
eses,
they are accepted as true, although subject to reevaluation as new evidence
is discovered. This is a successful method of reasoning about scientific
and other empirical matters because the physical world has a definite,
unique structure. It works because the laws of nature are consistent. In
the real world, it is entirely appropriate to assume that once you have
confirmed your hypothesis, all other hypotheses inconsistent with it are
incorrect.
</p><p>In the legal world, however, this assumption does not hold. This is
because unlike the laws of nature, political laws are not consistent. The
law human beings create to regulate their conduct is made up of incompatibl=
e,
contradictory rules and principles; and, as anyone who has studied a little
logic can demonstrate, <i>any</i> conclusion can be validly derived from
a set of contradictory premises. This means that a logically sound argument
can be found for any legal conclusion.
</p><p>When human beings engage in legal reasoning, they usually proceed in
the same manner as they do when engaged in empirical reasoning. They begin
with a hypothesis as to how a case should be decided and test it by searchi=
ng
for a sound supporting argument. After all, no one can &quot;reason&quot;=
 directly
to an unimagined conclusion. Without some end in view, there is no way
of knowing what premises to employ or what direction the argument should
take. When a sound argument is found, then, as in the case of empirical
reasoning, one naturally concludes that one&#x27;s legal hypothesis has been
shown to be correct, and further, <i>that all competing hypotheses are
therefore incorrect</i>.
</p><p>This is the fallacy of legal reasoning. Because the legal world is=
 comprised
of contradictory rules, there will be sound legal arguments available not
only for the hypothesis one is investigating, but for other, competing
hypotheses as well. The assumption that there is a unique, correct resoluti=
on,
which serves so well in empirical investigations, leads one astray when
dealing with legal matters. Kingsfield, who is well aware of this, knows
that Arnie and Ann have both produced legitimate legal arguments for their
competing conclusions. He does not reveal this knowledge to the class,
however, because the fact that this is possible is precisely what his stude=
nts
must discover for themselves if they are ever to learn to &quot;think like a
lawyer.&quot;

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">IV.
</p><p>Imagine that Arnie and Ann have completed their first year at Harvard
and coincidentally find themselves in the same second-year class on employm=
ent
discrimination law. During the portion of the course that focuses on Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<sup><a href=3D"#N_8_"> (8)</a></sup>
the class is asked to determine whether =A7 2000e-2(a)(1), which makes
it unlawful &quot;to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,
or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his
compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of
such individual&#x27;s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,&quot=
; permits
an employer to voluntarily institute an affirmative action program giving
preferential treatment to African-Americans. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Arnie
strongly believes that affirmative action programs are morally wrong and
that what the country needs are color-blind, merit-based employment practic=
es.
In researching the problem, he encounters the following principle of statut=
ory
construction: When the words are plain, courts may not enter speculative
fields in search of a different meaning, and the language must be regarded
as the final expression of legislative intent and not added to or subtracted
from on the basis of any extraneous source.<sup><a href=3D"#N_9_"> (9)</a><=
/sup>
In Arnie&#x27;s opinion, this principle clearly applies to this case. Secti=
on
2000e-2(a)(1) prohibits discrimination against any individual because of
his race. What wording could be more plain? Since giving preferential treat=
ment
to African-Americans discriminates against whites because of their race,
Arnie concludes that =A7 2000e-2(a)(1) prohibits employers from voluntarily
instituting affirmative action plans.
</p><p>Perhaps equally unsurprisingly, Ann has a strong belief that affirma=
tive
action is moral and is absolutely necessary to bring about a racially just
society. In the course of her research, she encounters the following princi=
ple
of statutory construction: &quot;It is a familiar rule, that a thing may be
within the letter of [a] statute and yet not within the statute because
not within its spirit, nor within the intention of its makers&quot;&#x27;;<=
sup><a href=3D"#N_10_">
(10)</a></sup> and that an interpretation which would bring about an end
at variance with the purpose of the statute must be rejected.<sup><a href=
=3D"#N_11_">
(11)</a></sup> Upon checking the legislative history, Ann learns that the
purpose of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act is to relieve &quot;the plight
of the Negro in our economy&quot; and &quot;open employment opportunities=
 for Negroes
in occupations which have been traditionally closed to them.&quot;<sup><a=
 href=3D"#N_12_">
(12)</a></sup> Since it would obviously contradict this purpose to interpret
=A7 2000e-2 to make it illegal for employers to voluntarily institute
affirmative action plans designed to economically benefit African-Americans
by opening traditionally closed employment opportunities, Ann concludes
that =A7 2000e-2 does not prohibit such plans.
</p><p>The next day, Arnie presents his argument for the illegality of affi=
rmative
action in class. Since Ann has found a sound legal argument for precisely
the opposite conclusion, she knows that Arnie&#x27;s position is untenable.
However, having gotten to know Arnie over the last year, this does not
surprise her in the least. She regards him as an inveterate reactionary
who is completely unprincipled in pursuit of his conservative (and probably
racist) agenda. She believes that he is advancing an absurdly narrow reading
of the Civil Rights Act for the purely political end of undermining the
purpose of the statute. Accordingly, she volunteers, and when called upon,
makes this point and presents her own argument demonstrating that affirmati=
ve
action is legal. Arnie, who has found a sound legal argument for his conclu=
sion,
knows that Ann&#x27;s position is untenable. However, he expected as much.=
 Over
the past year he has come to know Ann as a knee-jerk liberal who is willing
to do anything to advance her mushy-headed, left-wing agenda. He believes
that she is perversely manipulating the patently clear language of the
statute for the purely political end of extending the statute beyond its
legitimate purpose.
</p><p>Both Arnie and Ann know that they have found a logically sound argum=
ent
for their conclusion. But both have also committed the fallacy of legal
reasoning by assuming that under the law there is a uniquely correct resolu=
tion
of the case. Because of this assumption, both believe that their argument
demonstrates that they have found <i>the</i> objectively correct answer,
and that therefore, the other is simply playing politics with the law.
</p><p>The truth is, of course, that both are engaging in politics. Because
the law is made up of contradictory rules that can generate any conclusion,
what conclusion one finds will be determined by what conclusion one looks
for, i.e., by the hypothesis one decides to test. This will invariably
be the one that intuitively &quot;feels&quot; right, the one that is most=
 congruent
with one&#x27;s antecedent, underlying political and moral beliefs. Thus,=
 legal
conclusions are always determined by the normative assumptions of the decis=
ionmaker.
The knowledge that Kingsfield possesses and Arnie and Ann have not yet
discovered is that the law is never neutral and objective.

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">V.
</p><p>I have suggested that because the law consists of contradictory rules
and principles, sound legal arguments will be available for all legal concl=
usions,
and hence, the normative predispositions of the decisionmakers, rather
than the law itself, determine the outcome of cases. It should be noted,
however, that this vastly understates the degree to which the law is indete=
rminate.
For even if the law were consistent, the individual rules and principles
are expressed in such vague and general language that the decisionmaker
is able to interpret them as broadly or as narrowly as necessary to achieve
any desired result.
</p><p>To see that this is the case, imagine that Arnie and Ann have gradua=
ted
from Harvard Law School, gone on to distinguished careers as attorneys,
and later in life find, to their amazement and despair, that they have
both been appointed as judges to the same appellate court. The first case
to come before them involves the following facts:
</p><blockquote>A bankrupt was auctioning off his personal possessions to=
 raise
money to cover his debts. One of the items put up for auction was a painting
that had been in his family for years. A buyer attending the auction purcha=
sed
the painting for a bid of $100. When the buyer had the painting appraised,
it turned out to be a lost masterpiece worth millions. Upon learning of
this, the seller sued to rescind the contract of sale. The trial court
granted the rescission. The question on appeal is whether this judgment
is legally correct.</blockquote>
Counsel for both the plaintiff seller and defendant buyer agree that the
rule of law governing this case holds that a contract of sale may be rescin=
ded
when there has been a mutual mistake concerning a fact that was material
to the agreement. The seller claims that in the instant case there has
been such a mistake, citing as precedent the case of <i>Sherwood v. Walker<=
/i>.<sup><a href=3D"#N_13_">
(13)</a></sup> In <i>Sherwood</i>, one farmer sold another farmer a cow
which both farmers believed to be sterile. When the cow turned out to be
fertile, the seller was granted rescission of the contract of sale on the
ground of mutual mistake.<sup><a href=3D"#N_14_"> (14)</a></sup> The seller
argues that
<i>Sherwood</i> is exactly analogous to the present controversy.
Both he and the buyer believed the contract of sale was for an inexpensive
painting. Thus, both were mistaken as to the true nature of the object
being sold. Since this was obviously material to the agreement, the seller
claims that the trial court was correct in granting rescission.
<p>The buyer claims that the instant case is not one of mutual mistake,
citing as precedent the case of <i>Wood v. Boynton</i>.<sup><a href=3D"#N_1=
5_">
(15)</a></sup> In <i>Wood</i>, a woman sold a small stone she had found
to a jeweler for one dollar. At the time of the sale, neither party knew
what type of stone it was. When it subsequently turned out to be an uncut
diamond worth $700, the seller sued for rescission claiming mutual mistake.
The court upheld the contract, finding that since both parties knew that
they were bargaining over a stone of unknown value, there was no mistake.<s=
up><a href=3D"#N_16_">
(16)</a></sup> The buyer argues that this is exactly analogous to the prese=
nt
controversy. Both the seller and the buyer knew that the painting being
sold was a work of unknown value. This is precisely what is to be expected
at an auction. Thus, the buyer claims that this is not a case of mutual
mistake and the contract should be upheld.
</p><p>Following oral argument, Arnie, Ann, and the third judge on the cour=
t,
Bennie Stolwitz, a non-lawyer appointed to the bench predominantly because
the governor is his uncle, retire to consider their ruling. Arnie believes
that one of the essential purposes of contract law is to encourage people
to be self-reliant and careful in their transactions, since with the freedom
to enter into binding arrangements comes the responsibility for doing so.
He regards as crucial to his decision the facts that the seller had the
opportunity to have the painting appraised and that by exercising due care
he could have discovered its true value. Hence, he regards the contract
in this case as one for a painting of unknown value and votes to overturn
the trial court and uphold the contract. On the other hand, Ann believes
that the essential purpose of contract law is to ensure that all parties
receive a fair bargain. She regards as crucial to her decision the fact
that the buyer in this case is receiving a massive windfall at the expense
of the unfortunate seller. Hence, she regards the contract as one for an
inexpensive painting and votes to uphold the trial court&#x27;s decision and
grant rescission. This leaves the deciding vote up to Bennie, who has no
idea what the purpose of contract law is, but thinks that it just doesn&#x2=
7;t
seem right for the bankrupt guy to lose out, and votes for rescission.
</p><p>Both Arnie and Ann can see that the present situation bodes ill for
their judicial tenure. Each believes that the other&#x27;s unprincipled pol=
itical
manipulations of the law will leave Bennie, who is not even a lawyer, with
control of the court. As a result, they hold a meeting to discuss the situa=
tion.
At this meeting, they both promise to put politics aside and decide all
future cases strictly on the basis of the law. Relieved, they return to
court to confront the next case on the docket, which involves the following
facts:
</p><blockquote>A philosophy professor who supplements her academic salary
during the summer by giving lectures on political philosophy had contracted
to deliver a lecture on the rule of law to the Future Republicans of America
(FRA) on July 20, for $500. She was subsequently contacted by the Young
Socialists of America, who offered her $1000 for a lecture to be delivered
on the same day. She thereupon called the FRA, informing them of her desire
to accept the better offer. The FRA then agreed to pay $1000 for her lectur=
e.
After the professor delivered the lecture, the FRA paid only the originally
stipulated $500. The professor sued and the trial court ruled she was entit=
led
to the additional $500. The question on appeal is whether this judgment
is legally correct.</blockquote>
Counsel for both the plaintiff professor and defendant FRA agree that the
rule of law governing this case holds that a promise to pay more for servic=
es
one is already contractually bound to perform is not enforceable, but if
an existing contract is rescinded by both parties and a new one is negotiat=
ed,
the promise is enforceable. The FRA claims that in the instant case, it
had promised to pay more for a service the professor was already contractua=
lly
bound to perform, citing <i>Davis &amp; Co. v. Morgan</i><sup><a href=3D"#N=
_17_">
(17)</a></sup> as precedent. In <i>Davis</i>, a laborer employed for a
year at $40 per month was offered $65 per month by another company. The
employer then promised to pay the employee an additional $120 at the end
of the year if he stayed with the firm. At the end of the year, the employer
failed to pay the $120, and when the employee sued, the court held that
because he was already obligated to work for $40 per month for the year,
there was no consideration for the employer&#x27;s promise; hence, it was=
 unenforceable.<sup><a href=3D"#N_18_">
(18)</a></sup> The FRA argues that this is exactly analogous to the present
controversy. The professor was already obligated to deliver the lecture
for $500. Therefore, there was no consideration for the FRA&#x27;s promise=
 to
pay an additional $500 and the promise is unenforceable.
<p>The professor claims that in the instant case, the original contract
was rescinded and a new one negotiated, citing <i>Schwartzreich v. Bauman-B=
asch,
Inc</i>.<sup><a href=3D"#N_19_"> (19)</a></sup> as precedent. In <i>Schwart=
zreich</i>,
a clothing designer who had contracted for a year&#x27;s work at $90 per we=
ek
was subsequently offered $115 per week by another company. When the designer
informed his employer of his intention to leave, the employer offered the
designer $100 per week if he would stay and the designer agreed. When the
designer sued for the additional compensation, the court held that since
the parties had simultaneously rescinded the original contract by mutual
consent and entered into a new one for the higher salary, the promise to
pay was enforceable.<sup><a href=3D"#N_20_"> (20)</a></sup> The professor
argues that this is exactly analogous to the present controversy. When
the FRA offered to pay her an additional $500 to give the lecture, they
were obviously offering to rescind the former contract and enter a new
one on different terms. Hence, the promise to pay the extra $500 is enforce=
able.
</p><p>Following oral argument, the judges retire to consider their ruling.
Arnie, mindful of his agreement with Ann, is scrupulously careful not to
let political considerations enter into his analysis of the case. Thus,
he begins by asking himself why society needs contract law in the first
place. He decides that the objective, nonpolitical answer is obviously
that society needs some mechanism to ensure that individuals honor their
voluntarily undertaken commitments. From this perspective, the resolution
of the present case is clear. Since the professor is obviously threatening
to go back on her voluntarily undertaken commitment in order to extort
more money from the FRA, Arnie characterizes the case as one in which a
promise has been made to pay more for services which the professor is alrea=
dy
contractually bound to perform, and decides that the promise is unenforceab=
le.
Hence, he votes to overturn the trial court&#x27;s decision. Ann, also mind=
ful
of her agreement with Arnie, is meticulous in her efforts to ensure that
she decides this case purely on the law. Accordingly, she begins her analys=
is
by asking herself why society needs contract law in the first place. She
decides that the objective, nonpolitical answer is obviously that it provid=
es
an environment within which people can exercise the freedom to arrange
their lives as they see fit. From this perspective, the resolution of the
present case is clear. Since the FRA is essentially attempting to prevent
the professor from arranging her life as she sees fit, Ann characterizes
the case as one in which the parties have simultaneously rescinded an exist=
ing
contract and negotiated a new one, and decides that the promise is enforcea=
ble.
Hence, she votes to uphold the trial court&#x27;s decision. This once again
leaves the deciding vote up to Bennie, who has no idea why society needs
contract law, but thinks that the professor is taking advantage of the
situation in an unfair way and votes to overturn the trial court&#x27;s rul=
ing.
</p><p>Both Arnie and Ann now believe that the other is an incorrigible ide=
ologue
who is destined to torment him or her throughout his or her judicial existe=
nce.
Each is quite unhappy at the prospect. Each blames the other for his or
her unhappiness. But, in fact, the blame lies within each. For they have
never learned Professor Kingsfield&#x27;s lesson that it is impossible to=
 reach
an objective decision based solely on the law. This is because the law
is always open to interpretation and <i>there is no such thing as a normati=
vely
neutral interpretation</i>. The way one interprets the rules of law is
always determined by one&#x27;s underlying moral and political beliefs.

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">VI.
</p><p>I have been arguing that the law is not a body of determinate rules
that can be objectively and impersonally applied by judges; that what the
law prescribes is necessarily determined by the normative predispositions
of the one who is interpreting it. In short, I have been arguing that law
is inherently political. If you, my reader, are like most people, you are
far from convinced of this. In fact, I dare say I can read your thoughts.
You are thinking that even if I have shown that the present legal system
is somewhat indeterminate, I certainly have not shown that the law is inher=
ently
political. Although you may agree that the law as presently constituted
is too vague or contains too many contradictions, you probably believe
that this state of affairs is due to the actions of the liberal judicial
activists, or the Reaganite adherents of the doctrine of original intent,
or the self-serving politicians, or the ___________________________________=

eve
that the law must be this way, that it can never be definite and politically
neutral. You believe that the law can be reformed; that to bring about
an end to political strife and institute a true rule of law, we merely
need to create a legal system comprised of consistent rules that are expres=
sed
in clear, definite language.
</p><p>It is my sad duty to inform you that this cannot be done. Even with
all the good will in the world, we could not produce such a legal code
because there is simply no such thing as uninterpretable language. Now
I could attempt to convince you of this by the conventional method of regal=

you with myriad examples of the manipulation of legal language (e.g., an
account of how the relatively straightforward language of the Commerce
Clause giving Congress the power to &quot;regulate Commerce . . . among the

 Were

politics&quot;?
</p><p>I chose this portion of the First Amendment for my example because it
contains the clearest, most definite legal language of which I am aware.
If a provision as clearly drafted as this may be subjected to political
interpretation, what legal provision may not be? But this explains why
the legal system cannot be reformed to consist of a body of definite rules
yielding unique, objectively verifiable resolutions of cases. What a legal
rule means is always determined by the political assumptions of the person
applying it.<sup><a href=3D"#N_24_"> (24)</a></sup>

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">VII.
</p><p>Let us assume that I have failed to convince you of the impossibility
of reforming the law into a body of definite, consistent rules that produces
determinate results. Even if the law could be reformed in this way, <i>it
clearly should not be.</i> There is nothing perverse in the fact that the
law is indeterminate. Society is not the victim of some nefarious conspiracy
to undermine legal certainty to further ulterior motives. As long as law
remains a state monopoly, as long as it is created and enforced exclusively
through governmental bodies, it must remain indeterminate if it is to serve
its purpose. Its indeterminacy gives the law its flexibility. And since,
as a monopoly product, the law must apply to all members of society in
a one-size-fits-all manner, flexibility is its most essential feature.
</p><p>It is certainly true that one of the purposes of law is to ensure a
stable social environment, to provide order. But not just any order will
suffice. Another purpose of the law must be to do justice. The goal of
the law is to provide a social environment which is both orderly and just.
Unfortunately, these two purposes are always in tension. For the more defin=
ite
and rigidly- determined the rules of law become, the less the legal system
is able to do justice to the individual. Thus, if the law were fully determ=
inate,
it would have no ability to consider the equities of the particular case.
This is why even if we could reform the law to make it wholly definite
and consistent, we should not.
</p><p>Consider one of the favorite proposals of those who disagree. Those
who believe that the law can and should be rendered fully determinate usual=
ly
propose that contracts be rigorously enforced. Thus, they advocate a rule
of law stating that in the absence of physical compulsion or explicit fraud,
parties should be absolutely bound to keep their agreements. They believe
that as long as no rules inconsistent with this definite, clearly-drawn
provision are allowed to enter the law, politics may be eliminated from
contract law and commercial transactions greatly facilitated.
</p><p>Let us assume, contrary to fact, that the terms &quot;fraud&quot; an=
d &quot;physical
compulsion&quot; have a plain meaning not subject to interpretation. The qu=
estion
then becomes what should be done about Agnes Syester.<sup><a href=3D"#N_25_=
">
(25)</a></sup> Agnes was &quot;a lonely and elderly widow who fell for the=
 blandishments
and flattery of those who&quot; ran an Arthur Murray Dance Studio in DesMoi=
nes,
Iowa.<sup><a href=3D"#N_26_"> (26)</a></sup> This studio used some highly
innovative sales techniques to sell this 68-year-old woman 4,057 hours
of dance instruction, including three life memberships and a course in
Gold Star dancing, which was &quot;the type of dancing done by Ginger Rogers
and Fred Astair only about twice as difficult,&quot;<sup><a href=3D"#N_27_"=
> (27)</a></sup>
for a total cost of $33,497 in 1960 dollars. Of course, Agnes did voluntari=
ly
agree to purchase that number of hours. Now, in a case such as this, one
might be tempted to &quot;interpret&quot; the overreaching and unfair sales=
 practices
of the studio as fraudulent<sup><a href=3D"#N_28_"> (28)</a></sup> and allow
Agnes to recover her money. However, this is precisely the sort of solution
that our reformed, determinate contract law is designed to outlaw. Therefor=
e,
it would seem that since Agnes has voluntarily contracted for the dance
lessons, she is liable to pay the full amount for them. This might seem
to be a harsh result for Agnes, but from now on, vulnerable little old
ladies will be on notice to be more careful in their dealings.
</p><p>Or consider a proposal that is often advanced by those who wish to=
 render
probate law more determinate. They advocate a rule of law declaring a handw=
ritten
will that is signed before two witnesses to be absolutely binding. They
believe that by depriving the court of the ability to &quot;interpret&quot;=
 the state
of mind of the testator, the judges&#x27; personal moral opinions may be el=
iminated
from the law and most probate matters brought to a timely conclusion. Of
course, the problem then becomes what to do with Elmer Palmer, a young
man who murdered his grandfather to gain the inheritance due him under
the old man&#x27;s will a bit earlier than might otherwise have been the ca=
se.<sup><a href=3D"#N_29_">
(29)</a></sup> In a case such as this, one might be tempted to deny Elmer
the fruits of his nefarious labor despite the fact that the will was validly
drawn, by appealing to the legal principle that no one should profit from
his or her own wrong.<sup><a href=3D"#N_30_"> (30)</a></sup> However, this
is precisely the sort of vaguely-expressed counter-rule that our reformers
seek to purge from the legal system in order to ensure that the law remains
consistent. Therefore, it would seem that although Elmer may spend a consid=
erable
amount of time behind bars, he will do so as a wealthy man. This may send
a bad message to other young men of Elmer&#x27;s temperament, but from now=
 on
the probate process will be considerably streamlined.
</p><p>The proposed reforms certainly render the law more determinate. Howe=
ver,
they do so by eliminating the law&#x27;s ability to consider the equities of
the individual case. This observation raises the following interesting
question: If this is what a determinate legal system is like, who would
want to live under one? The fact is that the greater the degree of certainty
we build into the law, the less able the law becomes to do justice. For
this reason, a monopolistic legal system composed entirely of clear, consis=
tent
rules could not function in a manner acceptable to the general public.
It could not serve as a system of justice.

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">VIII.
</p><p>I have been arguing that the law is inherently indeterminate, and fu=
rther,
that this may not be such a bad thing. I realize, however, that you may
still not be convinced. Even if you are now willing to admit that the law
is somewhat indeterminate, you probably believe that I have vastly exaggera=
ted
the degree to which this is true. After all, it is obvious that the law
cannot be radically indeterminate. If this were the case, the law would
be completely unpredictable. Judges hearing similar cases would render
wildly divergent decisions. There would be no stability or uniformity in
the law. But, as imperfect as the current legal system may be, this is
clearly not the case.
</p><p>The observation that the legal system is highly stable is, of course,
correct, but it is a mistake to believe that this is because the law is
determinate. The stability of the law derives not from any feature of the
law itself, but from the overwhelming uniformity of ideological background
among those empowered to make legal decisions. Consider who the judges
are in this country. Typically, they are people from a solid middle- to
upper-class background who performed well at an appropriately prestigious
undergraduate institution; demonstrated the ability to engage in the type
of analytical reasoning that is measured by the standardized Law School
Admissions Test; passed through the crucible of law school, complete with
its methodological and political indoctrination; and went on to high-profile
careers as attorneys, probably with a prestigious Wall Street-style law
firm. To have been appointed to the bench, it is virtually certain that
they were both politically moderate and well-connected, and, until recently,
white males of the correct ethnic and religious pedigree. It should be
clear that, culturally speaking, such a group will tend to be quite homogen=
eous,
sharing a great many moral, spiritual, and political beliefs and values.
Given this, it can hardly be surprising that there will be a high degree
of agreement among judges as to how cases ought to be decided. But this
agreement is due to the common set of normative presuppositions the judges
share, not some immanent, objective meaning that exists within the rules
of law.
</p><p>In fact, however, the law is not truly stable, since it is continual=
ly,
if slowly, evolving in response to changing social mores and conditions.
This evolution occurs because each new generation of judges brings with
it its own set of &quot;progressive&quot; normative assumptions. As the old=
er generation
passes from the scene, these assumptions come to be shared by an ever-incre=
asing
percentage of the judiciary. Eventually, they become the consensus of opini=
on
among judicial decisionmakers, and the law changes to reflect them. Thus,
a generation of judges that regarded &quot;separate but equal&quot; as a pe=
rfectly
legitimate interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment<sup><a href=3D"#N_31_"> (31)</a></sup> gave way to one which inte=
rpreted
that clause as prohibiting virtually all governmental actions that classify
individuals by race, which, in turn, gave way to one which interpreted
the same language to permit &quot;benign&quot; racial classifications desig=
ned to
advance the social status of minority groups. In this way, as the moral
and political values conventionally accepted by society change over time,
so too do those embedded in the law.
</p><p>The law <i>appears</i> to be stable because of the slowness with whi=
ch
it evolves. But the slow pace of legal development is not due to any inhere=
nt
characteristic of the law itself. Logically speaking, any conclusion, howev=
er
radical, is derivable from the rules of law. It is simply that, even between
generations, the range of ideological opinion represented on the bench
is so narrow that anything more than incremental departures from convention=
al
wisdom and morality will not be respected within the profession. Such decis=
ions
are virtually certain to be overturned on appeal, and thus, are rarely
even rendered in the first instance.
</p><p>Confirming evidence for this thesis can be found in our contemporary
judicial history. Over the past quarter-century, the &quot;diversity&quot;=
 movement
has produced a bar, and concomitantly a bench, somewhat more open to people
of different racial, sexual, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds. To
some extent, this movement has produced a judiciary that represents a broad=
er
range of ideological viewpoints than has been the case in the past. Over
the same time period, we have seen an accelerated rate of legal change.
Today, long-standing precedents are more freely overruled, novel theories
of liability are more frequently accepted by the courts, and different
courts hand down different, and seemingly irreconcilable, decisions more
often. In addition, it is worth noting that recently, the chief complaint
about the legal system seems to concern the degree to which it has become
&quot;politicized.&quot; This suggests that as the ideological solidarity=
 of the
judiciary breaks down, so too does the predictability of legal decisionmaki=
ng,
and hence, the stability of the law. Regardless of this trend, I hope it
is now apparent that to assume that the law is stable because it is determi=
nate
is to reverse cause and effect. Rather, it is because the law is basically
stable that it appears to be determinate. It is not rule of law that gives
us a stable legal system; it is the stability of the culturally shared
values of the judiciary that gives rise to and supports the myth of the
rule of law.

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">IX.
</p><p>It is worth noting that there is nothing new or startling about the
claim that the law is indeterminate. This has been the hallmark of the
Critical Legal Studies movement since the mid-1970s. The &quot;Crits,&quot;=
 however,
were merely reviving the earlier contention of the legal realists who made
the same point in the 1920s and 30s. And the realists were themselves merely
repeating the claim of earlier jurisprudential thinkers. For example, as
early as 1897, Oliver Wendell Holmes had pointed out:
</p><blockquote>The language of judicial decision is mainly the language of
logic. And the logical method and form flatter that longing for certainty
and for repose which is in every human mind. But certainty generally is
illusion, and repose is not the destiny of man. Behind the logical form
lies a judgment as to the relative worth and importance of competing legisl=
ative
grounds, often an inarticulate and unconscious judgment, it is true, and
yet the very root and nerve of the whole proceeding. You can give any concl=
usion
a logical form.<sup><a href=3D"#N_32_"> (32)</a></sup></blockquote>
This raises an interesting question. If it has been known for 100 years
that the law does not consist of a body of determinate rules, why is the
belief that it does still so widespread? If four generations of jurispruden=
tial
scholars have shown that the rule of law is a myth, why does the concept
still command such fervent commitment? The answer is implicit in the questi=
on
itself, for the question recognizes that the rule of law is a myth and
like all myths, it is designed to serve an emotive, rather than cognitive,
function. The purpose of a myth is not to persuade one&#x27;s reason, but to
enlist one&#x27;s emotions in support of an idea. And this is precisely the
case for the myth of the rule of law; its purpose is to enlist the emotions
of the public in support of society&#x27;s political power structure.
<p>People are more willing to support the exercise of authority over themse=
lves
when they believe it to be an objective, neutral feature of the natural
world. This was the idea behind the concept of the divine right of kings.
By making the king appear to be an integral part of God&#x27;s plan for the
world rather than an ordinary human being dominating his fellows by brute
force, the public could be more easily persuaded to bow to his authority.
However, when the doctrine of divine right became discredited, a replacement
was needed to ensure that the public did not view political authority as
merely the exercise of naked power. That replacement is the concept of
the rule of law.
</p><p>People who believe they live under &quot;a government of laws and no=
t people&quot;
tend to view their nation&#x27;s legal system as objective and impartial.=
 They
tend to see the rules under which they must live not as expressions of
human will, but as embodiments of neutral principles of justice, i.e.,
as natural features of the social world. Once they believe that they are
being commanded by an impersonal law rather than other human beings, they
view their obedience to political authority as a public-spirited acceptance
of the requirements of social life rather than mere acquiescence to superior
power. In this way, the concept of the rule of law functions much like
the use of the passive voice by the politician who describes a delict on
his or her part with the assertion &quot;mistakes were made.&quot; It allow=
s people
to hide the agency of power behind a facade of words; to believe that it
is the law which compels their compliance, not self-aggrandizing politician=
s,
or highly capitalized special interests, or wealthy white Anglo-Saxon Prote=
stant
males, or _______________ (<i>fill in your favorite culprit</i>).
</p><p>But the myth of the rule of law does more than render the people sub=
missive
to state authority; it also turns them into the state&#x27;s accomplices in
the exercise of its power. For people who would ordinarily consider it
a great evil to deprive individuals of their rights or oppress politically
powerless minority groups will respond with patriotic fervor when these
same actions are described as upholding the rule of law.
</p><p>Consider the situation in India toward the end of British colonial=
 rule.
At that time, the followers of Mohandas Gandhi engaged in nonviolent civil
disobedience by manufacturing salt for their own use in contravention of
the British monopoly on such manufacture. The British administration and
army responded with mass imprisonments and shocking brutality. It is diffic=
ult
to understand this behavior on the part of the highly moralistic, ever-so-c=
ivilized
British unless one keeps in mind that they were able to view their activiti=
es
not as violently repressing the indigenous population, but as upholding
the rule of law.
</p><p>The same is true of the violence directed against the nonviolent civ=
il
rights protestors in the American South during the civil rights movement.
Although much of the white population of the southern states held racist
beliefs, one cannot account for the overwhelming support given to the viole=
nt
repression of these protests on the assumption that the vast majority of
the white Southerners were sadistic racists devoid of moral sensibilities.
The true explanation is that most of these people were able to view themsel=
ves
not as perpetuating racial oppression and injustice, but as upholding the
rule of law against criminals and outside agitators. Similarly, since despi=
te
the . 60s rhetoric, all police officers are not &quot;fascist pigs,&quot;=
 some other
explanation is needed for their willingness to participate in the &quot;pol=
ice
riot&quot; at the 1968 Democratic convention, or the campaign of illegal ar=
rests
and civil rights violations against those demonstrating in Washington again=
st
President Nixon&#x27;s policies in Vietnam, or the effort to infiltrate and
destroy the sanctuary movement that sheltered refugees from Salvadorian
death squads during the Reagan era or, for that matter, the attack on and
destruction of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco. It is only when these
officers have fully bought into the myth that &quot;we are a government of=
 laws
and not people,&quot; when they truly believe that their actions are comman=
ded
by some impersonal body of just rules, that they can fail to see that they
are the agency used by those in power to oppress others.
</p><p>The reason why the myth of the rule of law has survived for 100 years
despite the knowledge of its falsity is that it is too valuable a tool
to relinquish. The myth of impersonal government is simply the most effecti=
ve
means of social control available to the state.

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">X.
</p><p>During the past two decades, the legal scholars identified with the
Critical Legal Studies movement have gained a great deal of notoriety for
their unrelenting attacks on traditional, &quot;liberal&quot; legal theory.=
 The
<i>modus
operandi</i> of these scholars has been to select a specific area of the
law and show that because the rules and principles that comprise it are
logically incoherent, legal outcomes can always be manipulated by those
in power to favor their interests at the expense of the politically &quot;s=
ubordinated&quot;
classes. The Crits then argue that the claim that the law consists of deter=
minate,
just rules which are impartially applied to all is a ruse employed by the
powerful to cause these subordinated classes to view the oppressive legal
rulings as the necessary outcomes of an objective system of justice. This
renders the oppressed more willing to accept their socially subordinated
status. Thus, the Crits maintain that the concept of the rule of law is
simply a facade used to maintain the socially dominant position of white
males in an oppressive and illegitimate capitalist system.
</p><p>In taking this approach, the Crits recognize that the law is indeter=
minate,
and thus, that it necessarily reflects the moral and political values of
those empowered to render legal decisions. Their objection is that those
who currently wield this power subscribe to the wrong set of values. They
wish to change the legal system from one which embodies what they regard
as the hierarchical, oppressive values of capitalism to one which embodies
the more egalitarian, &quot;democratic&quot; values that they usually assoc=
iate with
socialism. The Crits accept that the law must be provided exclusively by
the state, and hence, that it must impose one set of values on all members
of society. Their contention is that the particular set of values currently
being imposed is the wrong one.
</p><p>Although they have been subjected to much derision by mainstream leg=
al
theorists,<sup><a href=3D"#N_33_"> (33)</a></sup> as long as we continue
to believe that the law must be a state monopoly, there really is nothing
wrong, or even particularly unique, about the Crits&#x27; line of argument.
There has always been a political struggle for control of the law, and
as long as all must be governed by the same law, as long as one set of
values must be imposed upon everyone, there always will be. It is true
that the Crits want to impose &quot;democratic&quot; or socialistic values=
 on everyone
through the mechanism of the law. But this does not distinguish them from
anyone else. Religious fundamentalists want to impose &quot;Christian&quot;=
 values
on all via the law. Liberal Democrats want the law to ensure that everyone
acts so as to realize a &quot;compassionate&quot; society, while conservati=
ve Republicans
want it to ensure the realization of &quot;family values&quot; or &quot;civ=
ic virtue.&quot;
Even libertarians insist that all should be governed by a law that enshrines
respect for individual liberty as its preeminent value.
</p><p>The Crits may believe that the law should embody a different set of
values than liberals, or conservatives, or libertarians, but this is the
only thing that differentiates them from these other groups. Because the
other groups have accepted the myth of the rule of law, they perceive what
they are doing not as a struggle for political control, but as an attempt
to depoliticize the law and return it to its proper form as the neutral
embodiment of objective principles of justice. But the rule of law is a
myth, and perception does not change reality. Although only the Crits may
recognize it, all are engaged in a political struggle to impose their versi=
on
of &quot;the good&quot; on the rest of society. And as long as the law rema=
ins the
exclusive province of the state, this will always be the case.

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">XI.
</p><p>What is the significance of these observations? Are we condemned to
a continual political struggle for control of the legal system? Well, yes;
as long as the law remains a state monopoly, we are. But I would ask you
to note that this is a conditional statement while you consider the followi=
ng
parable.
</p><p>A long time ago in a galaxy far away, there existed a parallel Earth
that contained a nation called Monosizea. Monosizea was remarkably similar
to the present-day United States. It had the same level of technological
development, the same social problems, and was governed by the same type
of common law legal system. In fact, Monosizea had a federal constitution
that was identical to that of the United States in all respects except
one. However, that distinction was quite an odd one. For some reason lost
to history, the Monosizean founding fathers had included a provision in
the constitution that required all shoes manufactured or imported into
Monosizea to be the same size. The particular size could be determined
by Congress, but whatever size was selected represented the only size shoe
permitted in the country.
</p><p>As you may imagine, in Monosizea, shoe size was a serious political
issue. Although there were a few radical fringe groups which argued for
either extremely small or extremely large sizes, Monosizea was essentially
a two-party system with most of the electorate divided between the Liberal
Democratic party and the Conservative Republican party. The Liberal Democra=
tic
position on shoe size was that social justice demanded the legal size to
be a large size such as a nine or ten. They presented the egalitarian argum=
ent
that everyone should have equal access to shoes, and that this could only
be achieved by legislating a large shoe size. After all, people with small
feet could still use shoes that were too large (even if they did have to
stuff some newspaper into them), but people with large feet would be comple=
tely
disenfranchised if the legal size was a small one. Interestingly, the Liber=
al
Democratic party contained a larger than average number of people who were
tall. The Conservative Republican position on shoe size was that respect
for family values and the traditional role of government required that
the legal size be a small size such as a four or five. They presented the
moralistic argument that society&#x27;s obligation to the next generation=
 and
government&#x27;s duty to protect the weak demanded that the legal size be=
 set
so that children could have adequate footwear. They contended that children
needed reasonably well- fitting shoes while they were in their formative
years and their feet were tender. Later, when they were adults and their
feet were fully developed, they would be able to cope with the rigors of
barefoot life. Interestingly, the Conservative Republican party contained
a larger than average number of people who were short.
</p><p>Every two years as congressional elections approached, and especially
when this corresponded with a presidential election, the rhetoric over
the shoe size issue heated up. The Liberal Democrats would accuse the Conse=
rvative
Republicans of being under the control of the fundamentalist Christians
and of intolerantly attempting to impose their religious values on society.
The Conservative Republicans would accuse the Liberal Democrats of being
misguided, bleeding-heart do-gooders who were either the dupes of the socia=
lists
or socialists themselves. However, after the elections, the shoe size legis=
lation
actually hammered out by the President and Congress always seemed to set
the legal shoe size close to a seven, which was the average foot size in
Monosizea. Further, this legislation always defined the size in broad terms
so that it might encompass a size or two on either side, and authorized
the manufacture of shoes made of extremely flexible materials that could
stretch or contract as necessary. For this reason, most averaged-sized
Monosizeans, who were predominantly politically moderate, had acceptable
footwear.
</p><p>This state of affairs seemed quite natural to everyone in Monosizea
except a boy named Socrates. Socrates was a pensive, shy young man who,
when not reading a book, was often lost in thought. His contemplative nature
caused his parents to think of him as a dreamer, his schoolmates to think
of him as a nerd, and everyone else to think of him as a bit odd. One day,
after learning about the Monosizean Constitution in school and listening
to his parents discuss the latest public opinion poll on the shoe size
issue, Socrates approached his parents and said:
</p><blockquote>I have an idea. Why don&#x27;t we amend the constitution to=
 permit
shoemakers to manufacture and sell more than one size shoe. Then everyone
could have shoes that fit and we wouldn&#x27;t have to argue about what the
legal shoe size should be anymore.</blockquote>
Socrates&#x27; parents found his naive idealism amusing and were proud that
their son was so imaginative. For this reason, they tried to show him that
his idea was a silly one in a way that would not discourage him from future
creative thinking. Thus, Socrates&#x27; father said:
<blockquote>That&#x27;s a very interesting idea, son, but it&#x27;s simply=
 not practical.
There&#x27;s always been only one size shoe in Monosizea, so that&#x27;s ju=
st the
way things have to be. People are used to living this way, and you can&#x27=
;t
fight city hall. I&#x27;m afraid your idea is just too radical.</blockquote>
Although Socrates eventually dropped the subject with his parents, he was
never satisfied with their response. During his teenage years, he became
more interested in politics and decided to take his idea to the Liberal
Democrats. He thought that because they believed all citizens were entitled
to adequate footwear, they would surely see the value of his proposal.
However, although they seemed to listen with interest and thanked him for
his input, they were not impressed with his idea. As the leader of the
local party explained:
<blockquote>Your idea is fine in theory, but it will never work in practice.
If manufacturers could make whatever size shoes they wanted, consumers
would be at the mercy of unscrupulous business people. Each manufacturer
would set up his or her own scale of sizes and consumers would have no
way of determining what their foot size truly was. In such a case, profit-h=
ungry
shoe sales people could easily trick the unwary consumer into buying the
wrong size. Without the government setting the size, there would be no
guarantee that any shoe was really the size it purported to be. We simply
cannot abandon the public to the vicissitudes of an unregulated market
in shoes.</blockquote>
To Socrates&#x27; protests that people didn&#x27;t seem to be exploited in=
 other
clothing markets and that the shoes manufactured under the present system
didn&#x27;t really fit very well anyway, the party leader responded:
<blockquote>The shoe market is unique. Adequate shoes are absolutely essent=
ial
to public welfare. Therefore, the ordinary laws of supply and demand cannot
be relied upon. And even if we could somehow get around the practical probl=
ems,
your idea is simply not politically feasible. To make any progress, we
must focus on what can actually be accomplished in the current political
climate. If we begin advocating radical constitutional changes, we&#x27;ll=
 be
routed in the next election.</blockquote>
Disillusioned by this response, Socrates approached the Conservative Republ=
icans
with his idea, explaining that if shoes could be manufactured in any size,
all children could be provided with the well-fitting shoes they needed.
However, the Conservative Republicans were even less receptive than the
Liberal Democrats had been. The leader of their local party responded quite
contemptuously, saying:
<blockquote>Look, Monosizea is the greatest, freest country on the face
of the planet, and it&#x27;s respect for our traditional values that has ma=
de
it that way. Our constitution is based on these values, and it has served
us well for the past 200 years. Who are you to question the wisdom of the
founding fathers? If you don&#x27;t like it in this country, why don&#x27;t=
 you just
leave?</blockquote>
Somewhat taken aback, Socrates explained that he respected the Monosizean
Constitution as much as they did, but that did not mean it could not be
improved. Even the founding fathers included a process by which it could
be amended. However, this did nothing to ameliorate the party leader&#x27;s
disdain. He responded:
<blockquote>It&#x27;s one thing to propose amending the constitution; it&#x=
27;s another
to undermine it entirely. Doing away with the shoe size provision would
rend the very fabric of our society. If people could make whatever size
shoes they wanted whenever they wanted, there would be no way to maintain
order in the industry. What you&#x27;re proposing is not liberty, it&#x27;s=
 license.
Were we to adopt your proposal, we would be abandoning the rule of law
itself. Can&#x27;t you see that what you are advocating is not freedom, but
anarchy?</blockquote>
After this experience, Socrates came to realize that there was no place
for him in the political realm. As a result, he went off to college where
he took up the study of philosophy. Eventually, he got a Ph.D., became
a philosophy professor, and was never heard from again.
<p>So, what is the point of this outlandish parable? I stated at the beginn=
ing
of this section that as long as the law remains a state monopoly, there
will always be a political struggle for its control. This sounds like a
cynical conclusion because we naturally assume that the law is necessarily
the province of the state. Just as the Monosizeans could not conceive of
a world in which shoe size was not set by the government, we cannot conceive
of one in which law is not provided exclusively by it. But what if we are
wrong? What if, just as Monosizea could eliminate the politics of shoe
size by allowing individuals to produce and buy whatever size shoes they
pleased, we could eliminate the politics of law by allowing individuals
to adopt whatever rules of behavior best fit their needs? What if law is
not a unique product that must be supplied on a one-size-fits-all basis
by the state, but one which could be adequately supplied by the ordinary
play of market forces? What if we were to try Socrates&#x27; solution and=
 end
the monopoly of law?

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">XII.
</p><p>The problem with this suggestion is that most people are unable to=
 understand
what it could possibly mean. This is chiefly because the language necessary
to express the idea clearly does not really exist. Most people have been
raised to identify law with the state. They cannot even conceive of the
idea of legal services apart from the government. The very notion of a
free market in legal services conjures up the image of anarchic gang warfare
or rule by organized crime. In our system, an advocate of free market law
is treated the same way Socrates was treated in Monosizea, and is confronted
with the same types of arguments.
</p><p>The primary reason for this is that the public has been politically
indoctrinated to fail to recognize the distinction between order and law.
Order is what people need if they are to live together in peace and securit=
y.
Law, on the other hand, is a particular method of producing order. As it
is presently constituted, law is the production of order by requiring all
members of society to live under the same set of state-generated rules;
it is order produced by centralized planning. Yet, from childhood, citizens
are taught to invariably link the words &quot;law&quot; and &quot;order.&qu=
ot; Political discourse
conditions them to hear and use the terms as though they were synonymous
and to express the desire for a safer, more peaceful society as a desire
for &quot;law and order.&quot;
</p><p>The state nurtures this confusion because it is the public&#x27;s in=
ability
to distinguish order from law that generates its fundamental support for
the state. As long as the public identifies order with law, it will believe
that an orderly society is impossible without the law the state provides.
And as long as the public believes this, it will continue to support the
state almost without regard to how oppressive it may become.
</p><p>The public&#x27;s identification of order with law makes it impossib=
le for
the public to ask for one without asking for the other. There is clearly
a public demand for an orderly society. One of human beings&#x27; most fund=
amental
desires is for a peaceful existence secure from violence. But because the
public has been conditioned to express its desire for order as one for
law, all calls for a more orderly society are interpreted as calls for
more law. And since under our current political system, all law is supplied
by the state, all such calls are interpreted as calls for a more active
and powerful state. The identification of order with law eliminates from
public consciousness the very concept of the decentralized provision of
order. With regard to legal services, it renders the classical liberal
idea of a market-generated, spontaneous order incomprehensible.
</p><p>I began this Article with a reference to Orwell&#x27;s concept of do=
ublethink.
But I am now describing the most effective contemporary example we have
of Orwellian &quot;newspeak,&quot; the process by which words are redefined=
 to render
certain thoughts unthinkable.<sup><a href=3D"#N_34_"> (34)</a></sup> Were
the distinction between order and law well-understood, the question of
whether a state monopoly of law is the best way to ensure an orderly society
could be intelligently discussed. But this is precisely the question that
the state does not wish to see raised. By collapsing the concept of order
into that of law, the state can ensure that it is not, for it will have
effectively eliminated the idea of a non-state generated order from the
public mind. Under such circumstances, we can hardly be surprised if the
advocates of a free market in law are treated like Socrates of Monosizea.

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">XIII.
</p><p>I am aware that this explanation probably appears as initially uncon=
vincing
as was my earlier contention that the law is inherently political. Even
if you found my Monosizea parable entertaining, it is likely that you regard
it as irrelevant. You probably believe that the analogy fails because shoes
are qualitatively different from legal services. After all, law is a public
good which, unlike shoes, really is crucial to public welfare. It is easy
to see how the free market can adequately supply the public with shoes.
But how can it possibly provide the order-generating and maintaining proces=
ses
necessary for the peaceful coexistence of human beings in society? What
would a free market in legal services be like?
</p><p>I am always tempted to give the honest and accurate response to this
challenge, which is that to ask the question is to miss the point. If human
beings had the wisdom and knowledge-generating capacity to be able to descr=
ibe
how a free market would work, that would be the strongest possible argument
for central planning. One advocates a free market not because of some moral
imprimatur written across the heavens, but because it is impossible for
human beings to amass the knowledge of local conditions and the predictive
capacity necessary to effectively organize economic relationships among
millions of individuals. It is possible to describe what a free market
in shoes would be like <i>because we have one</i>. But such a description
is merely an observation of the current state of a functioning market,
not a projection of how human beings would organize themselves to supply
a currently non-marketed good. To demand that an advocate of free market
law (or Socrates of Monosizea, for that matter) describe in advance how
markets would supply legal services (or shoes) is to issue an impossible
challenge. Further, for an advocate of free market law (or Socrates) to
even accept this challenge would be to engage in self-defeating activity
since the more successfully he or she could describe how the law (or shoe)
market would function, the more he or she would prove that it could be
run by state planners. Free markets supply human wants better than state
monopolies precisely because they allow an unlimited number of suppliers
to attempt to do so. By patronizing those who most effectively meet their
particular needs and causing those who do not to fail, consumers determine
the optimal method of supply. If it were possible to specify in advance
what the outcome of this process of selection would be, there would be
no need for the process itself.
</p><p>Although I am tempted to give this response, I never do. This is bec=
ause,
although true, it never persuades. Instead, it is usually interpreted as
an appeal for blind faith in the free market, and the failure to provide
a specific explanation as to how such a market would provide legal services
is interpreted as proof that it cannot. Therefore, despite the self-defeati=
ng
nature of the attempt, I usually do try to suggest how a free market in
law might work.
</p><p>So, what would a free market in legal services be like? As Sherlock
Holmes would regularly say to the good doctor, &quot;You see, Watson, but=
 you
do not observe.&quot; Examples of non-state law are all around us. Consider
labor-management collective bargaining agreements. In addition to setting
wage rates, such agreements typically determine both the work rules the
parties must abide by and the grievance procedures they must follow to
resolve disputes. In essence, such contracts create the substantive law
of the workplace as well as the workplace judiciary. A similar situation
exists with regard to homeowner agreements, which create both the rules
and dispute settlement procedures within a condominium or housing developme=
nt,
i.e., the law and judicial procedure of the residential community. Perhaps
a better example is supplied by universities. These institutions create
their own codes of conduct for both students and faculty that cover everyth=
ing
from academic dishonesty to what constitutes acceptable speech and dating
behavior. In addition, they not only devise their own elaborate judicial
procedures to deal with violations of these codes, but typically supply
their own campus police forces as well. A final example may be supplied
by the many commercial enterprises that voluntarily opt out of the state
judicial system by writing clauses in their contracts that require disputes
to be settled through binding arbitration or mediation rather than through
a lawsuit. In this vein, the variegated &quot;legal&quot; procedures that=
 have recently
been assigned the sobriquet of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) do
a good job of suggesting what a free market in legal service might be like.=
<sup><a href=3D"#N_35_">
(35)</a></sup>
</p><p>Of course, it is not merely that we fail to observe what is presently
all around us. We also act as though we have no knowledge of our own cultur=
al
or legal history. Consider, for example, the situation of African-American
communities in the segregated South or the immigrant communities in New
York in the first quarter of the twentieth century. Because of prejudice,
poverty and the language barrier, these groups were essentially cut off
from the state legal system. And yet, rather than disintegrate into chaotic
disorder, they were able to privately supply themselves with the rules
of behavior and dispute-settlement procedures necessary to maintain peacefu=
l,
stable, and highly structured communities. Furthermore, virtually none
of the law that orders our interpersonal relationships was produced by
the intentional actions of central governments. Our commercial law arose
almost entirely from the Law Merchant, a non-governmental set of rules
and procedures developed by merchants to quickly and peacefully resolve
disputes and facilitate commercial relations. Property, tort, and criminal
law are all the products of common law processes by which rules of behavior
evolve out of and are informed by the particular circumstances of actual
human controversies. In fact, a careful study of Anglo-American legal histo=
ry
will demonstrate that almost all of the law which facilitates peaceful
human interaction arose in this way. On the other hand, the source of the
law which produces oppression and social division is almost always the
state. Measures that impose religious or racial intolerance, economic explo=
itation,
one group&#x27;s idea of &quot;fairness,&quot; or another&#x27;s of &quot;c=
ommunity&quot; or &quot;family&quot;
values virtually always originate in legislation, the law consciously made
by the central government. If the purpose of the law really is to bring
order to human existence, then it is fair to say that the law actually
made by the state is precisely the law that does not work.
</p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how suggestive these examples might be, they
represent only what can develop within a state-dominated system. Since,
for the reasons indicated above, it is impossible to out-think a free marke=
t,
any attempt to account for what would result from a true free market in
law would be pure speculation. However, if I must engage in such speculatio=
n,
I will try to avoid what might be called &quot;static thinking&quot; in doi=
ng so.
Static thinking occurs when we imagine changing one feature of a dynamic
system without appreciating how doing so will alter the character of all
other features of the system. For example, I would be engaging in static
thinking were I to ask how, if the state did not provide the law and courts,
the free market could provide them <i>in their present form</i>. It is
this type of thinking that is responsible for the conventional assumption
that free market legal services would be &quot;competing governments&quot;=
 which
would be the equivalent of organized gang warfare. Once this static thinking
is rejected, it becomes apparent that if the state did not provide the
law and courts, they simply would not exist in their present form. This,
however, only highlights the difficulty of describing free market order-gen=
erating
services and reinforces the speculative nature of all attempts to do so.
</p><p>One thing it seems safe to assume is that there would not be any uni=
versally
binding, society-wide set of &quot;legal&quot; rules. In a free market, the=
 law would
not come in one-size-fits-all. Although the rules necessary to the maintena=
nce
of a minimal level of order, such as prohibitions against murder, assault,
and theft, would be common to most systems, different communities of intere=
st
would assuredly adopt those rules and dispute-settlement procedures that
would best fit their needs. For example, it seems extremely unlikely that
there would be anything resembling a uniform body of contract law. Consider,
as just one illustration, the differences between commercial and consumer
contracts. Commercial contracts are usually between corporate entities
with specialized knowledge of industrial practices and a financial interest
in minimizing the interruption of business. On the other hand, consumer
contracts are those in which one or both parties lack commercial sophistica=
tion
and large sums do not rest upon a speedy resolution of any dispute that
might arise. In a free market for legal services, the rules that govern
these types of contracts would necessarily be radically different.
</p><p>This example can also illustrate the different types of dispute-sett=
lement
procedures that would be likely to arise. In disputes over consumer contrac=
ts,
the parties might well be satisfied with the current system of litigation
in which the parties present their cases to an impartial judge or jury
who renders a verdict for one side or the other. However, in commercial
disputes, the parties might prefer a mediational process with a negotiated
settlement in order to preserve an ongoing commercial relationship or a
quick and informal arbitration in order to avoid the losses associated
with excessive delay. Further, it is virtually certain that they would
want mediators, arbitrators, or judges who are highly knowledgeable about
commercial practice, rather than the typical generalist judge or a jury
of lay people.
</p><p>The problem with trying to specify the individuated &quot;legal syst=
ems&quot;
which would develop is that there is no limit to the number of dimensions
along which individuals may choose to order their lives, and hence no limit
to the number of overlapping sets of rules and dispute resolution procedures
to which they may subscribe. An individual might settle his or her disputes
with neighbors according to voluntarily adopted homeowner association rules
and procedures, with co-workers according to the rules and procedures descr=
ibed
in a collective bargaining agreement, with members of his or her religious
congregation according to scriptural law and tribunal, with other drivers
according to the processes agreed to in his or her automobile insurance
contract, and with total strangers by selecting a dispute resolution company
from the yellow pages of the phone book. Given the current thinking about
racial and sexual identity, it seems likely that many disputes among members
of the same minority group or among women would be brought to &quot;niche&q=
uot; dispute
resolution companies composed predominantly of members of the relevant
group, who would use their specialized knowledge of group &quot;culture&quo=
t; to
devise superior rules and procedures for intra-group dispute resolution.<su=
p><a href=3D"#N_36_">
(36)</a></sup>
</p><p>I suspect that in many ways a free market in law would resemble the
situation in Medieval Europe before the rise of strong central governments
in which disputants could select among several fora. Depending upon the
nature of the dispute, its geographical location, the parties&#x27; status,
and what was convenient, the parties could bring their case in either villa=
ge,
shire, urban, merchant, manorial, ecclesiastical, or royal courts. Even
with the limited mobility and communications of the time, this restricted
market for dispute-settlement services was able to generate the order neces=
sary
for both the commercial and civil advancement of society. Consider how
much more effectively such a market could function given the current level
of travel and telecommunication technology. Under contemporary conditions,
there would be an explosion of alternative order-providing organizations.
I would expect that, late at night, wedged between commercials for Veg-o-ma=
tic
and Slim Whitman albums, we would find television ads with messages such
as, &quot;Upset with your neighbor for playing rock and roll music all night
long? Is his dog digging up your flower beds? Come to Acme Arbitration
Company&#x27;s grand opening two for one sale.&quot;
</p><p>I should point out that, despite my earlier disclaimer, even these=
 suggestions
embody static thinking since they assume that a free market would produce
a choice among confrontational systems of justice similar to the one we
are most familiar with. In fact, I strongly believe that this would not
be the case. The current state-supplied legal system is adversarial in
nature, pitting the plaintiff or prosecution against the defendant in a
winner-take-all, loser-get-nothing contest. The reason for this arrangement
has absolutely nothing to do with this procedure&#x27;s effectiveness in se=
ttling
disputes and everything to do with the medieval English kings&#x27; desire=
 to
centralize power. For historical reasons well beyond the scope of this
Article, the Crown was able to extend its temporal power relative to the
feudal lords as well as raise significant revenue by commanding or enticing
the parties to local disputes to bring their case before the king or other
royal official for decision.<sup><a href=3D"#N_37_"> (37)</a></sup> Our cur=
rent
system of adversarial presentation to a third-party decisionmaker is an
outgrowth of these early &quot;public choice&quot; considerations, not its=
 ability
to successfully provide mutually satisfactory resolutions to interpersonal
disputes.
</p><p>In fact, this system is a terrible one for peacefully resolving disp=
utes
and would be extremely unlikely to have many adherents in a free market.
Its adversarial nature causes each party to view the other as an enemy
to be defeated, and its winner-take-all character motivates each to fight
as hard as he or she can to the bitter end. Since the loser gets nothing,
he or she has every reason to attempt to reopen the dispute, which gives
rise to frequent appeals. The incentives of the system make it in each
party&#x27;s interest to do whatever he or she can to wear down the opponent
while being uniformly opposed to cooperation, compromise, and reconciliatio=
n.
That this is not the kind of dispute-settlement procedure people are likely
to employ if given a choice is evidenced by the large percentage of litigan=
ts
who are turning to ADR in an effort to avoid it.
</p><p>My personal belief is that under free market conditions, most people
would adopt compositional, rather than confrontational, dispute settlement
procedures, i.e., procedures designed to compose disputes and reconcile
the parties rather than render third party judgments. This was, in fact,
the essential character of the ancient &quot;legal system&quot; that was re=
placed
by the extension of royal jurisdiction. Before the rise of the European
nation-states, what we might anachronistically call judicial procedure
was chiefly a set of complex negotiations between the parties mediated
by the members of the local community in an effort to reestablish a harmoni=
ous
relationship. Essentially, public pressure was brought upon the parties
to settle their dispute peacefully through negotiation and compromise.
The incentives of this ancient system favored cooperation and conciliation
rather than defeating one&#x27;s opponent.<sup><a href=3D"#N_38_"> (38)</a>=
</sup>
</p><p>Although I have no crystal ball, I suspect that a free market in law
would resemble the ancient system a great deal more than the modern one.
Recent experiments with negotiated dispute-settlement have demonstrated
that mediation 1) produces a higher level of participant satisfaction with
regard to both process and result, 2) resolves cases more quickly and at
significantly lower cost, and 3) results in a higher rate of voluntary
compliance with the final decree than was the case with traditional litigat=
ion.<sup><a href=3D"#N_39_">
(39)</a></sup> This is perhaps unsurprising, given that mediation&#x27;s la=
ck
of a winner-take-all format encourages the parties to seek common ground
rather than attempt to vanquish the opponent and that, since both parties
must agree to any solution, there is a reduced likelihood that either will
wish to reopen the dispute. Given human beings&#x27; manifest desire to ret=
ain
control over their lives, I suspect that, if given a choice, few would
willingly place their fate in the hands of third-party decisionmakers.
Thus, I believe that a free market in law would produce a system that is
essentially compositional in nature.

</p><p style=3D"text-align: CENTER">XIV.
</p><p>In this Article, I have suggested that when it comes to the idea of
the rule of law, the American public is in a state of deep denial. Despite
being surrounded by evidence that the law is inherently political in nature,
most people are nevertheless able to convince themselves that it is an
embodiment of objective rules of justice which they have a moral obligation
to obey. As in all cases of denial, people participate in this fiction
because of the psychological comfort that can be gained by refusing to
see the truth. As we saw with our friends Arnie and Ann, belief in the
existence of an objective, non-ideological law enables average citizens
to see those advocating legal positions inconsistent with their values
as inappropriately manipulating the law for political purposes, while viewi=
ng
their own position as neutrally capturing the plain meaning immanent within
the law. The citizens&#x27; faith in the rule of law allows them to hide fr=
om
themselves both that their position is as politically motivated as is their
opponents&#x27; and that they are attempting to impose their values on their
opponents as much as their opponents are attempting to impose their values
on them. But, again, as in all cases of denial, the comfort gained comes
at a price. For with the acceptance of the myth of the rule of law comes
a blindness to the fact that laws are merely the commands of those with
political power, and an increased willingness to submit oneself to the
yoke of the state. Once one is truly convinced that the law is an impersona=
l,
objective code of justice rather than an expression of the will of the
powerful, one is likely to be willing not only to relinquish a large measure
of one&#x27;s own freedom, but to enthusiastically support the state in the
suppression of others&#x27; freedom as well.
</p><p>The fact is that there is no such thing as a government of law and=
 not
people. The law is an amalgam of contradictory rules and counter-rules
expressed in inherently vague language that can yield a legitimate legal
argument for any desired conclusion. For this reason, as long as the law
remains a state monopoly, it will always reflect the political ideology
of those invested with decisionmaking power. Like it or not, we are faced
with only two choices. We can continue the ideological power struggle for
control of the law in which the group that gains dominance is empowered
to impose its will on the rest of society, or we can end the monopoly.
</p><p>Our long-standing love affair with the myth of the rule of law has=
 made
us blind to the latter possibility. Like the Monosizeans, who after centuri=
es
of state control cannot imagine a society in which people can buy whatever
size shoes they wish, we cannot conceive of a society in which individuals
may purchase the legal services they desire. The very idea of a free market
in law makes us uncomfortable. But it is time for us to overcome this disco=
mfort
and consider adopting Socrates&#x27; approach. We must recognize that our=
 love
for the rule of law is unrequited, and that, as so often happens in such
cases, we have become enslaved to the object of our desire. No clearer
example of this exists than the legal process by which our Constitution
was transformed from a document creating a government of limited powers
and guaranteed rights into one which provides the justification for the
activities of the all-encompassing super-state of today. However heart-wren=
ching
it may be, we must break off this one-sided affair. The time has come for
those committed to individual liberty to realize that the establishment
of a truly free society requires the abandonment of the myth of the rule
of law.

nihilists and attacked for undermining the commitment to the rule of law
that is necessary for the next generation of lawyers to engage in the princ=

ethical practice of law. For this reason, their mainstream critics have
suggested that the Crits have no business teaching in the nation&#x27;s law
schools. See, e.g., Paul D. Carrington, <i>Of Law and the River</i>, 34

</p><p><a name=3D"N_37_"></a>37. The story of how royal jurisdiction came to
supplant all others and why the adversarial system of litigation replaced
the earlier methods of settling disputes is fascinating one, but one which
obviously cannot be recounted here. Those interested in pursuing it may
wish to consult Harold J. Berman, Law and Revolution (1983); Leonard W.
Levy, Origins of the Fifth Amendment (1986).
