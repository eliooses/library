<p class="smalltext">Lecture to the memory of Alfred Nobel,   December 8, 1979</p>
<h2>The Economics of Being Poor<a href="#not">*</a></h2>
<p>Most of the people in the world are poor,   so if we knew the economics of being poor, we would know much of   the economics that really matters. Most of the world&#8217;s poor   people earn their living from agriculture, so if we knew the   economics of agriculture, we would know much of the economics of   being poor.</p>
<p>People who are rich find it hard to   understand the behaviour of poor people. Economists are no   exception, for they too find it difficult to comprehend the   preferences and scarcity constraints that determine the choices   that poor people make. We all know that most of the world&#8217;s   people are poor, that they earn a pittance for their labor, that   half and more of their meager income is spent on food, that they   reside predominantly in low income countries and that most of   them are earning their livelihood in agriculture. What many   economists fail to understand is that poor people are no less   concerned about improving their lot and that of their children   than rich people are.</p>
<p>What we have learned in recent decades   about the economics of agriculture will appear to most reasonably   well informed people to be paradoxical. We have learned that   agriculture in many low income countries has the potential   economic capacity to produce enough food for the still growing   population and in so doing can improve significantly the income   and welfare of poor people. The decisive factors of production in   improving the welfare of poor people are not space, energy and   cropland; the decisive factor is the improvement in population   quality.</p>
<p>In discussing these propositions, I shall   first identify two intellectual mistakes that have marred the   work of many economists. I shall then point out that most   observers overrate the economic importance of land and greatly   underrate the importance of the quality of human agents. Lastly I   shall present measurements of the increases in population quality   that low income countries are currently achieving.</p>
<p>Much of what I have learned about these   propositions I owe to the research of predoctoral and   postdoctoral students, to subsequent studies during their   professional careers, and to my academic colleagues. In recent   decades their work has produced a veritable explosion in the   understanding of the economics of human capital, with special   reference to the economics of research, the responses of farmers   to new profitable production techniques, the connection between   production and welfare, and the economics of the family.</p>
<p><b>Mistakes by economists</b><br />   This branch of economics has suffered from several intellectual   mistakes. The major mistake has been the presumption that   standard economic theory is inadequate for understanding low   income countries and that a separate economic theory is needed.   Models developed for this purpose were widely acclaimed until it   became evident that they were at best intellectual curiosities.   The reaction of some economists was to turn to cultural and   social explanations for the alleged poor economic performance of   low income countries. Quite understandably, cultural and   behavioral scholars are uneasy about this use of their studies.   Fortunately, the intellectual tide has begun to turn. Increasing   numbers of economists have come to realize that standard economic   theory is just as applicable to the scarcity problems that   confront low income countries as to the corresponding problems of   high income countries.</p>
<p>A second mistake is the neglect of economic   history. Classical economics was developed when most people in   Western Europe were very poor, barely scratching out subsistence   from the poor soils they tilled and they were condemned to a   short life span. As a result, early economists dealt with   conditions that were similar to those that prevail in low income   countries today. In Ricardo&#8217;s day about half of the family income   of laborers in England went for food. So it is today in many low   income countries. Marshall (1920) tells us that &#8220;&#8230; English   labourers&#8217; weekly wages were often less than the price of a half   bushel of good wheat&#8221;, at the time that Ricardo published his   classic work. The weekly wage of the ploughman in India is   currently somewhat less than the price of two bushels of wheat   (Schultz, 1977a, 1977b). In India many people live under the   Ricardian shadow. Understanding the experience and achievements   of poor people over the ages can contribute much to understanding   the problems and possibilities of low income countries today.   That kind of understanding is far more important than the most   detailed and exact knowledge about the surface of the earth, or   of ecology, or of tomorrow&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>Historical perception is also lacking with   respect to population. We extrapolate global statistics and are   horrified by our interpretation of them, mainly that poor people   breed like lemmings headed toward their own destruction. Yet that   is not what happened looking back at our own social and economic   history when people were poor. It is equally false with respect   to population growth in today&#8217;s poor countries.</p>
<p><b>Land is overrated</b><br />   A widely held view &#8211; the natural earth view &#8211; is that there is a   virtually fixed land area suitable for growing food, and a supply   of energy for tilling the land that is being depleted. According   to this view, it is impossible to continue to produce enough food   for the growing world population. An alternative view &#8211; the   social-economic view &#8211; is that man has the ability and   intelligence to lessen his dependence on cropland, on traditional   agriculture and on depleting sources of energy and can reduce the   real costs of producing food for the growing world population. By   means of research we discover substitutes for cropland, which   Ricardo could not have anticipated, and as incomes rise parents   reveal a preference for fewer children, substituting quality for   quantity of children, which Malthus could not have foreseen. It   is ironic that economics, long labelled the dismal science, is   capable of showing that the bleak natural earth view for food is   not compatible with economic history; that history demonstrates   that we can augment resources by advances in knowledge. I agree   with Margaret Mead: &#8220;The future of mankind is open ended.&#8221;   Mankind&#8217;s future is not foreordained by space, energy and   cropland. It will be determined by the intelligent evolution of   humanity.</p>
<p>Differences in the productivity of the   soils is not a useful variable to explain why people are poor in   long-settled parts of the world. People in India have been poor   for ages both on the Deccan Plateau where the productivity of the   rain-fed soils is low, and on the highly productive soils of   South India. In Africa, people on the unproductive soils of the   southern fringes of the Sahara, on the somewhat more productive   soils on the steep slopes of the Rift landform, and on the highly   productive alluvial lands along and at the mouth of the Nile, all   have one thing in common: they are very poor. Similarly, the much   publicized differences in land-population ratio throughout the   low income countries do not produce comparable differences in   poorness. What matters most in the case of farmland are the   incentives and associated opportunities that farm people have to   augment the effective supply of land by means of investments that   include the contributions of agricultural research and the   improvements of human skills.</p>
<p>A fundamental proposition documented by   much recent research is that an integral part of the   modernization of the economists of low income countries is <i>the   decline in the economic importance of farmland and a rise in that   of human capital &#8211; skills and knowledge.</i></p>
<p>Despite economic history, scratch an   economist and you will find that his ideas about land are still,   as a rule, those of Ricardo. But Ricardo&#8217;s concept of land, &#8220;the   original and indestructible powers of the soil&#8221;, is no longer   adequate, if ever it was. The share of national income that   accrues as land rent and the associated social and political   importance of landlords have declined markedly over time in high   income countries and they are also declining in low income   countries. Why is Ricardian Rent losing its economic sting? There   are two primary reasons: first, the modernization of agriculture   has over time transformed raw land into a vastly more productive   resource than it was in its natural state, and second,   agricultural research has provided substitutes for cropland. With   some local exceptions, the original soils of Europe were poor in   quality. They are today highly productive. The original soils of   Finland were less productive that the nearby western parts of the   Soviet Union, yet today the croplands of Finland are superior.   Japanese croplands were originally much inferior to those in   Northern India; they are greatly superior today. Some part of   these changes, both in high and in low income countries, is the   consequence of agricultural research including the research   embodied in purchased agricultural inputs. There are new   substitutes for cropland (call it land augmentation if you so   prefer). The substitution process is well illustrated by corn.   The corn acreage harvested in the United States in 1970 was 33   million acres less than in 1932. Yet the 7.59 billion bushels   produced in 1979 was three times the amount produced in 1932.</p>
<p><b>The quality of human agents is   underrated</b><br />   While land <i>per se</i> is not a critical factor in being poor,   the human agent is: investment in improving population quality   can significantly enhance the economic prospects and the welfare   of poor people. Child care, home and work experience, the   acquisition of information and skills through schooling and in   other ways consisting primarily of investment in health and   schooling, can improve population quality. Such investments in   low income countries have, as I shall show, been successful in   improving the economic prospects wherever they have not been   dissipated by political instability. Poor people in low income   countries are not prisoners of an ironclad poverty equilibrium   that economics is unable to break. There are no overwhelming   forces that nullify all economic improvements causing poor people   to abandon the economic struggle. It is now well documented that   in agriculture poor people do respond to better   opportunities.</p>
<p>The expectations of human agents in   agriculture &#8211; farm laborers and farm entrepreneurs who both work   and allocate resources &#8211; are shaped by new opportunities and by   the incentives to which they respond. These incentives are   explicit in the prices that farmers receive for their products   and in the prices they pay for producer and consumer goods and   services that they purchase. These incentives are greatly   distorted in many low income countries (Schultz, 1978b). The   effect of these government induced distortions is to reduce the   economic contribution that agriculture is capable of making.</p>
<p>The &#8220;reason&#8221; why governments tend to   introduce distortions that discriminate against agriculture is   that internal politics generally favor the urban population at   the expense of rural people, despite the much greater size of the   rural population.<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a> 1 The political   influence of urban consumers and industry enables them to exact   cheap food at the expense of the vast number of poor rural   people. This discrimination against agriculture is rationalized   on the grounds that agriculture is inherently backward and that   its economic contribution is of little importance despite the   occasional &#8220;green revolution&#8221;. The lowly cultivator is viewed as   indifferent to economic incentives because it is presumed that he   is strongly committed to his traditional ways of cultivation.   Rapid industrialization is viewed as the key to economic   progress. Policy is designed to give top priority to industry,   which includes keeping food grains cheap. It is regrettable but   true that this doctrine is still supported by some donor agencies   and rationalized by some economists in high income countries.</p>
<p><b>Entrepreneurs</b><br />   Farmers the world over, in dealing with costs, returns and risks,   are calculating economic agents. Within their small, individual,   allocative domain they are fine-tuning entrepreneurs, tuning so   subtly that many experts fail to recognize how efficient they   are. I first presented an analysis of this entrepreneurial   behaviour in <i>Transforming Traditional Agriculture</i>   (Schultz, 1964). Although farmers differ for reasons of   schooling, health and experience in their ability to perceive, to   interpret and to take appropriate action in responding to new   information, they provide an essential human resource which is   entrepreneurship (Welch, 1970, 1978; Evenson, 1978). On most   farms there is a second enterprise, the household. Women are also   entrepreneurs in allocating their own time and in using farm   products and purchased goods in household production (Schultz,   1974). This allocative ability is supplied by millions of men and   women on smallscale producing units; agriculture is in general a   highly decentralized sector of the economy. Where governments   have taken over this function in farming, they have prevented   this entrepreneurial talent from being used and these governments   have been unsuccessful in providing an effective allocative   substitute, capable of modernizing agriculture. The allocative   roles of farmers and of farm women are important and their   economic opportunities really matter (Schultz, 1978b).</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship is also essential in   research. All research is a venturesome business. It entails   allocating scarce resources. It requires organization. Someone   must decide how to allocate the limited resources available for   research given the existing state of knowledge. The very essence   of research is that it is a dynamic venture into the unknown or   partially known. Funds, organizations and competent scientists   are necessary. They are not sufficient. Research entrepreneurship   is required, be it by scientists or by others engaged in the   research sector of the economy (Schultz, 1979c).</p>
<p><b>Inevitability of disequilibria</b><br />   The transformation of agriculture into an increasingly more   productive state, a process that is commonly referred to as   &#8220;modernization&#8221;, entails all manner of adjustments in farming as   better opportunities become available. I have shown that the   value of the ability to deal with disequilibria is high in a   dynamic economy (Schultz, 1975).</p>
<p>Such <i>disequilibria are inevitable</i>.   They cannot be eliminated by law, by public policy, and surely   not by rhetoric. Governments cannot perform efficiently the   function of farm entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Future historians will no doubt be puzzled   by the extent to which economic incentives were impaired during   recent decades. The dominant intellectual view is antagonistic to   agricultural incentives and the prevailing economic policies   deprecate the function of producer incentives. For lack of   incentives the unrealized economic potential of agriculture in   many low income countries is large (D. Gale Johnson, 1977, 1978).   Technical possibilities have become increasingly more favorable,   but the economic incentives that are required for farmers in   these countries to realize this potential are in disarray, either   because the relevant information is lacking or because the prices   and costs they face have been distorted. For want of profitable   incentives, farmers have not made the necessary investments,   including the purchase of superior inputs. Interventions by   governments are currently the major cause of the lack of optimum   economic incentives.</p>
<p><b>Achievements in population   quality</b><br />   I now turn to measurable gains in the quality of both farm and   nonfarm people (Schultz, 1979a, 1979b). Quality in this context   consists of various forms of human capital. I have argued   elsewhere (Schultz, 1974) that while a strong case can be made   for using a rigorous definition of human capital, it will be   subject to the same ambiguities that continue to plague capital   theory in general and the capital concept in economic growth   models in particular. Capital is two-faced, and what these two   faces tell us about economic growth, which is a dynamic process,   are, as a rule, inconsistent stories. It must be so because the   cost story is a tale about sunk investments, and the other story   pertains to the discounted value of the stream of services that   such capital renders, which changes with the shifting sands of   growth. But worse still is the capital homogeneity assumption   underlying capital theory and the aggregation of capital in   growth models. As Hicks (1965) has taught us, the capital   homogeneity assumption is the disaster of capital theory. This   assumption is demonstrably inappropriate in analyzing the   dynamics of economic growth that is afloat on capital   inequalities because of the differences in the rates of return,   whether the capital aggregation is in terms of factor costs or in   terms of the discounted value of the lifetime services of its   many parts. Nor would a catalogue of all existing growth models   prove that these inequalities are equals. But why try to square   the circle? If we were unable to observe these inequalities, we   would have to invent them because <i>they are the mainspring of   economic growth</i>. They are the mainspring because they are the   compelling economic signals of growth. Thus, one of the essential   parts of economic growth is concealed by such capital   aggregation.</p>
<p>The value of additional human capital   depends on the additional wellbeing that human beings derive from   it. Human capital contributes to labor productivity and to   entrepreneurial ability. This allocative ability is valuable in   farm and nonfarm production, in household production, and in the   time and other resources that students allocate to their   education. It is also valuable in migration to better job   opportunities and to better locations in which to live. It   contributes importantly to satisfactions that are an integral   part of current and future consumption.</p>
<p>My approach to population quality is to   treat quality as a scarce resource, which implies that it has an   economic value and that its acquisition entails a cost. In   analyzing human behavior that determines the type and amount of   quality that is acquired over time, the key to the analysis is   the relation between the returns from additional quality and the   costs of acquiring it. When the returns exceed costs, the stock   of population quality will be enhanced. This means that increases   in the supply of any quality component is a response to a demand   for it. It is a supply-demand approach to investment behavior   because all quality components are here treated as durable scarce   resources that are useful over some period of time.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that the returns to   various quality components are increasing over time in many low   income countries; the rents that entrepreneurs derive from their   allocative ability rise, so do the returns to child care,   schooling, and improvements in health. Furthermore, the rates of   return are enhanced by the reductions in the costs of acquiring   most of these quality components. Over time the increases in the   demand for quality, in children and on the part of adults in   enhancing their own quality, reduces the demand for quantity;   that is, quality and quantity are substitutes and the reduction   in demand for quantity favors having and rearing fewer children   (Becker and Tomes, 1976; Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1978). The   movement toward quality contributes to the solution of the   population &#8220;problem&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Investment in health</b><br />   Human capital theory treats everyone&#8217;s state of health as a   stock, i.e., as health capital, and its contribution as health   services. Part of the quality of the initial stock is inherited   and part is acquired. The stock depreciates over time and at an   increasing rate in later life. Gross investment in human capital   entails acquisition and maintenance costs. These investments   include child care, nutrition, clothing, housing, medical   services, and the use of one&#8217;s own time. The flow of services   that health capital renders consists of &#8220;healthy time&#8221;, or   &#8220;sicknes-free time&#8221;, which are inputs into work, consumption and   leisure activities (Williams, 1977; Grossman, 1972).</p>
<p>The improvements in health revealed by the   longer life span of people in many low income countries has   undoubtedly been the most important advance in population   quality. Since about 1950, life expectancy at birth has increased   40 percent or more in many of these countries. People of Western   Europe and North America never attained so large an increase in   life expectancy in so short a period. The decline in mortality of   infants and very young children is only a part of this   achievement. The mortality of older children, youths and adults   is also down.</p>
<p>Ram and Schultz (1979) deal with the   economics of these demographic developments in India. The results   correspond to those in other low income countries. In India from   1951 to 1971, life expectancy at birth of males increased by 43   percent, and that of females by 41 percent. Life spans over the   life cycle after age 10, 20 and on to age 60, for both males and   females in 1971, were also decidedly longer than in 1951.</p>
<p>The favorable economic implications of   these increases in life span are pervasive. Foremost are the   satisfactions that people derive from longer life. While they are   hard to measure, there is little room for doubt that the value of   life expectancy is enhanced. Measurement, however, is not   impossible. Usher (1978) devised an ingenious extension of theory   to determine the utility that people derive from increases in   life expectancy. His empirical analysis indicates that the   additional utility increases substantially the value of personal   income.</p>
<p>Longer life spans provide additional   incentives to acquire more education, as investments in future   earnings. Parents invest more in their children. More on-the-job   training becomes worthwhile. The additional health capital and   the other forms of human capital tend to increase the   productivity of workers. Longer life spans result in more years   participation in the labor force, and bring about a reduction in   &#8220;sick time&#8221;. Better health and vitality of workers in turn lead   to more productivity per manhour at work.</p>
<p>The Ram-Schultz study provides evidence on   the gains in the productivity of agricultural labor in India,   realized as a consequence of improvements in health. The most   telling part of that evidence is the productivity effect of the   cycle that has characterized the malaria program.</p>
<p><b>Investment in education</b><br />   Education accounts for much of the improvements in population   quality. But reckoning the cost of schooling, the value of the   work that young children do for their parents must be included.   Even for the very young children during their first years of   school, most parents forego (sacrifice) the value of the work   that children perform (Makhija, 1977; Shortlidge, 1976;   Rosenzweig and Evenson, 1977). Another distinctive attribute of   schooling is the vintage effect by age over time. Starting from   widespread illiteracy, as more schooling per child is achieved,   the older adults continue through life with little or no   schooling, whereas the children on entering into adulthood are   the beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The population of India grew about 50   percent between 1950-51 and 1970-71. School enrollment of   children ages 6 to 14 rose over 200 percent. The rate of increase   in secondary schools and universities was much higher (Government   of India, 1978). Since schooling is primarily an investment, it   is a serious error to treat all schooling outlays as current   consumption. This error arises from the assumption that schooling   is solely a consumer good. It is misleading to treat public   expenditures on schooling as &#8220;welfare&#8221; expenditures, and as a use   of resources that has the effect of reducing &#8220;savings&#8221;. The same   error occurs in the case of expenditures on health, both on   public and private account.</p>
<p>The expenditures on schooling including   higher education are a substantial fraction of national income in   many low income countries. These expenditures are <i>large</i>   relative to the conventional national accounting measures   (concepts) of savings and investment. In India the proportion   that the costs of schooling bear to national income, savings and   investment is not only large but it has tended to increase   substantially over time (Ram and Schultz, 1979, pp. 410-12 and   Table 2).</p>
<p><b>The highly skilled</b><br />   In assessing population quality, it is important not to overlook   the increases in the stock of physicians, other medical   personnel, engineers, administrators, accountants, and various   classes of research scientists and technicians (Schultz,   1979d).</p>
<p>The research capacity of a considerable   number of low income countries is impressive. There are   specialized research institutes, research units within   governmental departments, industrial sector research, and   on-going university research. The scientists and technicians   engaged in these various research activities are university   trained, some of them in universities abroad. The research areas   include, among others, medicine, public health (control of   communicable diseases and the delivery of health services),   nutrition, industry, agriculture, and even some atomic energy   research. I shall touch briefly on agricultural research, because   I know it best and because it is well documented.</p>
<p>The founding and financing of the   International Agricultural Research Centers is an institutional   innovation of a high order. The entrepreneurship of the   Rockefeller Foundation in cooperation with the government of   Mexico first launched this type of venture. But these centers,   good as they are, are not a substitute for national agricultural   research enterprises. Suffice it to give the flavor of the   remarkable increases in the number of agricultural scientists   between 1959 and 1974 in 22 selected low income countries. All   told the number of scientist man years devoted to agricultural   research in these 22 countries increased more than three times   during this period. By 1974 there was a corps of over 13,000   scientists, ranging from 110 in the Ivory Coast to over 2,000 in   India (Boyce and Evenson, 1975). Indian agricultural research   expenditures between 1950 and 1968 also more than tripled in real   terms.</p>
<p>We come to the bottom line. In India this   investment in agricultural research has produced excellent   results. An analysis by states within India shows the rate of   return has been approximately 40 percent, which is indeed high   compared to the returns from most other investments to increase   agricultural production (Evenson and Kislev, 1975).</p>
<p><b>Concluding remark</b><br />   While there remains much that we do not know about the economics   of being poor, our knowledge of the economic dynamics of low   income countries has advanced substantially in recent decades. We   have learned that poor people are no less concerned about   improving their lot and that of their children than those of us   who have incomparably greater advantages. Nor are they any less   competent in obtaining the maximum benefit from their limited   resources. The central thrust of this lecture is that population   quality and knowledge matter. A goodly number of low income   countries have a positive record in improving population quality   and in acquiring useful knowledge. These achievements imply   favorable economic prospects, provided they are not dissipated by   politics and governmental policies that discriminate against   agriculture.</p>
<p>Even so, most of the people throughout the   world continue to earn a pittance from their labor. Half or even   more of their meager income is spent on food. Their life is   harsh. Farmers in low income countries do all they can to augment   production. What happens to these farmers is of no concern to the   sun, or to the earth, or to the behavior of the monsoons and the   winds that sweep the face of the earth. Farmers&#8217; crops are in   constant danger of being devoured by insects and pests. Nature is   host to thousands of species that are hostile to the endeavors of   farmers, especially so in low income countries. We in the high   income countries have forgotten the wisdom of Alfred Marshall,   when he wrote, &#8220;Knowledge is the most powerful engine of   production; it enables us to subdue Nature and satisfy our   wants.&#8221;</p>
