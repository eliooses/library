<p class="smalltext">Lecture to the memory of Alfred Nobel, March   17, 1975</p>
<p class="smalltext"> </p>
<h2>The Equality Issue in World Development</h2>
<p>My first impulse, when brooding over what   topic I should choose for this lecture, was that I should turn   toward some specific problem, selected from the field where I am   at present working. But then I felt that more appropriate for   this very special occasion would be that I should talk in more   sweeping terms about a broader problem, and I chose the equality   issue in world development. I shall dwell upon the economic,   financial, social, psychological and political conditioning of   our thinking about that issue, which is at bottom, a moral   issue.</p>
<p>Our knowledge, as well as our ignorance, at   any time and on every issue, tends to be opportunistically   conditioned, and thus brought to deviate from full truth. In   every epoch and every problem, this opportunistic tendency   operates also in our scientific work, if not critically   scrutinized. This view dawned upon me more than forty years ago,   when I analyzed the political element in the development of   economic theory. I have then over the years found this hypothesis   confirmed by my studies in many different fields and, of course,   during my ten years as Executive Secretary of the United Nations   Economic Commission for Europe, responsible for operational work   in relations with governments, as well as for research.</p>
<p><b>I</b><br />   When I am now working on a study of the broad social and economic   dynamics of race relations in the United States since the time,   more than thirty years ago, when I wrote <i>An American   Dilemma</i>, it has struck me how different the whole outlook on   the world could be during the late Roosevelt era, compared with   now. In most respects the world issues seemed to be, and in a   sense were then, simpler, much less complex.</p>
<p>Leaving all other differences aside, what   then was referred to by the static term the &#8220;backward regions&#8221;   were held at rest, within the colonial power structure. Their   continued economic stagnation in great poverty was taken for   granted, without exerting much interest on the part of the public   in the rich countries, nor among their economic scientists.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important effect of World   War II was the rapid dissolution of that power structure &#8211;   although not having been part of the war aims of any belligerent   country and not expected anywhere. Beginning with the   quasivoluntary decolonization of the British dependencies on the   Indian subcontinent and the rest of South Asia, it swept over the   globe like a hurricane, reaching also regions where there had   been virtually no indigenous liberation movement foreboding and,   in some measure, preparing for the change. The result was the   coming into existence in a rapid sequence of a great number of   new, politically independent countries, which all were very poor   and mostly stagnant, economically and socially, but where the   educated elite, who thought and acted on their behalf, now raised   the demand for development.</p>
<p>In turn, as a subsequent effect of that   political change the general public in the Western countries were   suddenly forced to become aware of the huge income gap as between   the poor majority of mankind and the rich minority, as well as   the further fact that this income gap is continually widening, as   indeed it had been doing for more than a century. An isolating   wall of inattention, and an ignorance made possible by that   opportunistic bent of mind, had been broken through.</p>
<p>The poverty of what now came to be known as   &#8220;underdeveloped countries&#8221;, a dynamic term, became recognized to   be a problem. This represented a momentous redirection of public   interest. Within this movement there went also an equally radical   redirection of economic research, for the first time giving   importance to these countries&#8217; abject poverty and also to the   policy methods, which could initiate progress there by planning   for development.</p>
<p>This new awareness of the poverty in   underdeveloped countries was bound to be morally disturbing in   the Western world, where, particularly since Enlightenment, the   ideal of greater equality has had an honored place in social   philosophy. In economic science it had even been &#8220;proven&#8221; and   placed at the basis of economic theory. The influence on   practical policy of that recognized ideal had been minor,   however, until towards the end of the last century economic   conditions and power relations in one Western country after   another began to make possible gradually to turn them into   &#8220;welfare states.&#8221; This process also implied greater awareness of   existing inequalities.</p>
<p>From the beginning we find also that among   the new policy proposals of economists aimed at instigating   development in the underdeveloped countries, besides the   prescriptions for economic planning, there was included a demand   for economic assistance from the developed countries. In fact,   much of the writings of economists in that early stage of the   postwar era, as in many cases even later, became focused upon   urging the politicians and the general public in the developed   countries to be prepared to come forward with technical   assistance, capital aid, and commercial concessions.</p>
<p>This was a new element in Western thinking.   Until then, the colonial power system had served as a protective   shield for consciences in Western developed countries. There   anyhow existed no political basis for sensing any degree of   collective international responsibility for what happened in the   colonial dependiencies of some West European countries, for   instance no surge for a discussion in the League of Nations about   how to help them to develop.</p>
<p>And the otherwise highly idealistic charter   of the United Nations, drawn up before the end of World War II,   had little to say about the right to political independence for   the peoples in the &#8220;backward regions.&#8221; The Charter was still less   outspoken about how to spur and aid development in the   underdeveloped countries that would come to emerge.</p>
<p>But almost from the beginning, the United   Nations and its specialized agencies became now the sounding   boards for demands, raised by the representatives of the   underdeveloped countries, for aid from, and commercial   considerations of the developed countries. During the three   decades of its existence, the effectiveness of the United Nations   has, on the whole, tended to decrease, particularly in the field   of peace and security and, more generally, all issues in which   the developed countries feel they have important stakes. But this   whole system of intergovernmental organizations has more and more   become agencies for discussing, analyzing, and promoting   development in underdeveloped countries. Their secretariats   produce statistics and studies aimed at ascertaining, analyzing,   demonstrating, and publicizing the pertinent elements of their   poverty and the possible means of lifting them out of it. This is   part of the process through which a compelling awareness of their   plight has been engendered in the postwar period and forced   itself upon every alert person.</p>
<p>Under the pressure of the underdeveloped   countries, who have grown in number of votes and gradually   learned to cooperate and work out a common stand, the developed   countries have gradually been brought to make some, although   minor concessions in their commercial policies and even to   subscribe the funds for permitting old and newly created agencies   in the United Nations family of intergovernmental organizations   to provide technical assistance and capital aid. Still   multilateral aid has remained only very small in relation to   needs, and even compared with unilateral aid however it is   calculated.</p>
<p>The aid urged in the economic literature   and discussed in the several developed and underdeveloped   countries at home and in the United Nations was at that time   never thought of by anybody as needing to be more than marginal.   Part of the explanation of this was undoubtedly the optimistic   slant of early economic theorizing about the development problems   in underdeveloped countries, originating from the common   disregard for the &#8220;non-economic&#8221; factors, broadly attitudes and   institutions and, in particular, the social and economic   stratification, that raise so much greater inhibitions and   obstacles to development in these countries which for ages have   been stagnant. This optimism was, of course, also in the selfish   interest of the developed countries as it implied that   underdeveloped countries could develop with less aid.</p>
<p>But I must confess that when, twenty years   ago in the middle of the Fifties, I delivered a series of   lectures in Cairo focused on the same topic as my present lecture   (later published in a volume, <i>Economic Theory and   Underdeveloped Regions</i>), and in spite of my already then   having attempted to redirect my thinking in an institutional   direction, I could assert:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is needed is not primarily a   redistribution of wealth and incomes. Indeed, aid can only be a   very small part of a rational international equalization   program&#8230; None of the schemes which have been propounded for   capital aid for development of underdeveloped countries has ever   amounted to taking away more than a tiny fraction of the yearly   increase of national income per head in the richer countries,   which implied that no real sacrifice has ever been envisaged&#8230; A   wholesale income equalization by redistribution between nations   is both impossible and, I am inclined to believe, an unimportant   objective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among things which, at that time, besides   defects in our theoretical approaches, contributed to our common   overoptismism in regard to planning for development in   underdeveloped countries, was that only gradually, toward the   censuses around 1960, did we have reasons to worry much about a   population explosion, as population increases as known up till   then had not been proceeding at too alarming a rate. Also, the   anxiety emerging in more recent years about depletion of not   renewable resources had not then drawn our attention to the   tremendous inequality in the use of resources. The challenge was   not apparent of the virtual necessity of bringing down the   consumption of these and other resources in the developed   countries, if development should be possible in the   underdeveloped ones.</p>
<p>To this new configuration of the problems   in these underdeveloped countries and of our relations with them   I will lead up to in the second part of my lecture.</p>
<p>In the developed world, the political   climate at that early time did certainly not encourage economic   scientists to raise more than very modest proposals for aid to   the newly discovered world of age-old poverty.</p>
<p>In the beginning and continually for a long   time, what of aid was given came almost only from the United   States. Most European countries faced themselves a serious   reconstruction problem. For a second time the United States had   emerged from a world war richer than ever and with its productive   assets undamaged. The Marshall aid program for Western Europe &#8211;   on a much grander scale than any aid later afforded   underdeveloped countries, given on much more generous terms, and   lasting until the middle of the Fifties &#8211; undoubtedly tended to   crowd out considerations to give much aid to the development of   underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p>During the rapid decolonization, American   aid to the newly independent countries had a very slow start and   remained, for years, on a diminutive scale with the partial   exception of the aid given to the United States&#8217; former colony,   the Philippines, which had also, like her European allies,   suffered wartime destruction. When then in the Fifties American   aid began to take somewhat larger proportions, it became,   however, geared to the intensifying cold war and aimed at   supporting politically allied governments or, sometimes, to   reward a not unfriendly neutrality. This is clearly visible in   the distribution of aid among countries.</p>
<p>Aid was from the beginning motivated as   being &#8220;in the best interests of the United States&#8221;, and these   interests were primarily defined in the crude terms of political,   strategic and military advantages for the United States. Most of   the aid to underdeveloped countries became, directly and   indirectly, military aid. It was nevertheless, at the same time,   in some vague way also conceived to be an aid to development   given for humanitarian reasons. This latter motivation was,   however, increasingly pushed in the shadow.</p>
<p>Toward the middle and end of the Fifties   West European countries became somewhat more important as   providers of aid to underdeveloped countries. It was partly due   to the prodding of the United States, that these countries as   they regained economic viability should shoulder their share of   the aid burden. They, too, commonly tended to view aid from the   point of view of their national interests, though those interests   were conceived more in terms of export and the retention of   cultural and, in particular, commercial links with former   colonial dependencies, and less as offering political, strategic   and military advantages.</p>
<p>Finally it should be recalled, that the aid   coming from the Communist bloc was on an even smaller scale and   more definitely geared to political interests in the raging cold   war.</p>
<p>Aid did gradually rise towards the   beginning of the Sixties, although the motivations on the part of   the aid-giving governments had as a result a skewed distribution   among countries. Then the solemn designation 1960 by the United   Nations General Assembly of the next ten years as the Development   Decade, at the proposal of the newly elected President of the   United States, John F. Kennedy, did contain implicit and explicit   but vague promises on behalf of the developed countries of more   substantial aid for development.</p>
<p>But what actually happened was that from   about that time on, the rising trend instead stagnated and began   to steer downwards. In the United States this movement has   continued until now. Because of its weight among developed   countries, aid in real terms has even globally continually been   decreasing and, what is even more important, the &#8220;quality&#8221; of aid   has in several respects been deteriorating.</p>
<p>Even though in this brief lecture I cannot   be more specific, I must refer to the fact that the statistics   and budget figures for aid have been opportunistically juggled by   the United States government and, to a lesser extent, by most   other Western governments as, more lately, they became more   important as providers of aid. Building upon these figures, the   falsification has then been continued and given authority by the   Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of OECD, the organization   of all the non-Communist developed countries.</p>
<p>The misrepresentation of the facts has been   most glaring in regard to what the DAC secretariat calls the &#8220;net   flows&#8221; of private capital to the underdeveloped countries, where   not only profits on foreign investments but also capital   movements, often capital flight, are not accounted for. This was   bluntly pointed out in DAC already in 1969 by the Swedish   Minister of Industry, Krister Wickman.</p>
<p>But even the &#8220;public flows&#8221; of aid proper   have been systematically beguiled to conceal the downward trend.   Often the figures have been used without discounting for the   rising trend of prices. Loans, which during the Sixties were   continually substituted for grants, were without proper   qualifications reckoned as aid. Tying aid to exports from the   &#8220;donor country&#8221;, which had gradually become the general rule in   almost all Western countries, implies mostly higher import costs   for the underdeveloped countries. Particularly in regard to the   United States, items of military aid are often smuggled into the   computations as aid to development.</p>
<p>As the Sixties progressed towards its close   and continuing till now, the political character of aid has   become ever more pronounced in the United States. A prime   operative factor was, of course, the increasing military   involvement in the Vietnam war, which has implied &#8220;aid&#8221; on a   large scale to the Saigon government and later to the Cambodian   insurgent government, and some other satellite governments in   South East Asia.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that these easily   detected opportunistic manipulations of the aid statistics have   been demonstrated in some detail, the officially presented,   misleading figures are, mostly without any qualifications, quoted   and utilized by officials, politicians and journalists all over   the world. In the same way they are used by the delegates and   secretariats of intergovernmental organizations. They are usually   accepted even by representatives of underdeveloped countries and   by those in developed countries who argue for increasing the   amount of aid.</p>
<p>The lack of zeal on the part of most   professional economists to scrutinize the statistical figures on   aid is to me embarrassing, like their often uncritical use of   many other statistics from underdeveloped countries, their   acceptance of a diplomatically twisted terminology and, more   fundamentally, their use of systems of analytical concepts that   are inadequate to the situation in underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p>The naked truth is, that when the present   emergency came, aid in any real sense was low and tended to go   even lower.</p>
<p>My next point is that the motivation given   for a policy does matter, not only in a deeper moral sense, but   also for its affectiveness.</p>
<p>In the United States, where aid to   underdeveloped countries has been continuously argued as being in   &#8220;our country&#8217;s best interest&#8221;, with these interests more and more   specified as located in the military sphere, foreign aid has   increasingly lost its popular appeal. The fact that the foreign   policies supposedly served by this direction of aid has met   defeat in Southeast Asia and also been less than successful in   Latin America and other parts of the world, can only have made   people in America ever more sceptical and adverse to foreign aid   supposed to serve these purposes. Since long the American   government has had to fight in every Congress to save the foreign   aid appropriations from being cut down more than they have   actually been.</p>
<p>Even liberal Congressmen have shown   increasing resistance to stand for foreign aid. They fear even   that aid, given that direction, may lead the United States into   military involvements like the one in Vietnam. Conservative   Congressmen have meant that any aid goes down in a rat hole, to   use an American expression.</p>
<p>The United States&#8217; major West European   allies and, in particular, Britain, France, and West Germany,   have argued for foreign aid in a considerably less nationalistic   spirit, and in any case not attached primary importance to their   strategic and military interests in the cold war. They have, at   the same time, been able to hold up their aid appropriations   better than the United States.</p>
<p>In a few, mostly smaller developed   countries, where aid has been allowed to increase and is mostly   still increasing &#8211; and where aid is also accounted for in a   generally more correct way &#8211; the arguments for aid in terms of   national self-interest have been given less weight or been   entirely absent.</p>
<p>Sweden, where the government has been   committed to increase its aid by twenty-five per cent each year,   is, of course, a case in point. None of the nationalistic motives   for aid in the United States and, to a lesser extent, present   also in its major West European allied countries, could with any   credibility be presented to the Swedish people. Aid has had to be   argued in terms of human solidarity and compassion with the   needy. Also in the other Scandinavian countries and, for   instance, in the Netherlands or Canada, the situation is not too   different.</p>
<p>My theory is that the selfish national   interests, particularly as they so often turn out to have been   spurious and misconceived, do not appeal to ordinary people, who   in our type of countries determine the course of public policy   over the years, while a motivation in moral terms carries weight.   When in the United States the general public appears massively   indifferent to foreign aid, this may be, as an American author   has stated it, because the appeal has not been made to the   humanitarianism and fundamental decency of the ordinary American.   I cannot believe that Americans are basically less charitable   than Swedes.</p>
<p>I find support for my theory in the   consistent correlation between behavior in regard to aid and the   reasons given for aid in the United States, its major West   European allies, and the third group of smaller nations,   respectively. If I had the time, I could furnish more specific   reasons for my theory than this broad correlation. I insist that   I am offering this theory not merely as the opinion of a moralist   but as the conclusion of an economic scientist who has devoted   study to the problem. When politicians and experts become timid   about giving due importance to moral commitments, realism is   absent.</p>
<p>I have stressed this theory, as I will have   to come back to the fundamental moral problem, when I now come to   deal with the present calamitous situation in the world.   Meanwhile, I should note that even in those countries, that were   more generous with aid, it was still on a marginal level, not   implying much real sacrifice for their peoples.</p>
<p><b>II</b><br />   In recent years there have been sudden, major changes in the   world economy. They have radically affected the economic   situation of all underdeveloped countries, though in different   directions and degrees, and thereby the entire setting of the   equality problem I am discussing in this lecture. For by far the   larger part of the peoples in underdeveloped countries, these   changes have been worsening their development prospects and in   many countries are now threatening the survival of large numbers   of their poor masses. The type of marginal foreign aid we have   provided, is clearly not enough to meet their barest needs.</p>
<p>The underdeveloped countries are therefore   now proclaiming the necessity of not only increased aid but   fundamental changes of international economic relations. By their   majority votes they can in the United Nations carry resolutions   like the &#8220;Declaration on the Establishment of a New International   Economic Order&#8221;, passed at the conclusion of the Special Session   of the United Nations General Assembly held in April 1974 to   consider the emergency situation.</p>
<p>At the World Food Conference in November of   the same year a declaration was passed on the eradication of   hunger and malnutrition, establishing the right of &#8220;every man,   woman and child&#8230; to be free from hunger and malnutrition&#8221;, and   stressing the &#8220;fundamental responsibility of the governments to   work together&#8221; for reaching that goal. The new commitments made   by the developed countries and the new institutions created fell,   however, far short of assuring even a modest beginning of   implementing these ideals or even to prevent a further serious   deterioration of the food situation in underdeveloped   countries.</p>
<p>Particularly delegates from the group of   smaller countries that had already in the earlier epoch   consistently shown more sympathy for the cravings of   underdeveloped countries and who have also maintained or even   increased their modest aid, have often voted for the most general   though noncommital declarations. And they have sometimes   positively expressed agreement with the radical demands for a new   world order, which logically must imply an infringement of their   countries share of the world&#8217;s resources. They must then have   spoken and voted without much sincerity, as they cannot have been   ignorant about the fact, that the nations they represent are not   really prepared to give up privileges, least of all on a scale   commensurate with their general promises. To this I shall come   back.</p>
<p>In my further, utterly compressed and   summary remarks on the profound changes that have brought about a   critically new setting of the world equality problem, I will view   these changes from the restricted viewpoint of their impact on   underdeveloped countries and of the preparedness in developed   countries to come to their aid.</p>
<p>A few of the underdeveloped countries,   those having oil for export, have succeeded to form an effective   cartel, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,   raising the price of oil four and a half to six and a half times   the earlier price, depending upon what base year is chosen for   comparison. They have suddenly become immensely rich. Except a   few of them, like Nigeria and Indonesia, they were among the   richer of the underdeveloped countries already before, or at   least not so poor.</p>
<p>In an estimate, which is naturally very   uncertain, the World Bank has reckoned that the accumulated   surplus revenues could reach $450 and $550 billion by the end of   1980. The revenues for last year have been estimated to exceed   those for 1973 &#8211; when for some few months the oil prices had   already been pressed up to a much higher level &#8211; by some $60 to   $65 billion, of which about $10 billion have to be paid by   underdeveloped countries. This more than swallows up all aid they   had been getting, however inflated as in the faulty DAC   statistics. And then is not counted the rise in prices of the   fertilizers and other oilbased products they need to produce or   import.</p>
<p>On the whole, other underdeveloped   countries have avoided criticizing the OPEC countries. They   apparently sensed a new power and admired as a novel phenomenon   the authority and unity with which the OPEC countries conducted   their negotiations with the foreign oil companies and the   developed countries. Those few underdeveloped countries which   export copper, bauxite and tin and even those exporting rubber,   sugar, cocoa and coffee saw new cpportunities, and they had for a   time their hopes supported in the general commodity boom which   lasted until almost a year ago.</p>
<p>Studies made generally tend to support the   view, that the countries in OPEC will have good opportunity to   hold up the oil prices &#8211; if there is not a new outbreak of war in   the Middle East, or if the developed Western countries do not   fall into a very serious slump, when in both cases the future of   oil prices as well as many other things become entirely   unpredictable. But the other commodity exporting underdeveloped   countries will probably not succeed to follow the same pattern to   any considerable extent. And they represent anyhow, like the oil   exporting countries, only a small part of the peoples living in   underdeveloped countries. On the whole, with clear exceptions,   the underdeveloped world is rather less endowed with marketable   resources of this type than the developed countries were when   they developed, and are even now.</p>
<p>All underdeveloped countries which depend   on oil imports will suffer a setback to their development   programs. It can be shown to be broadly true, however, that the   poorest among the underdeveloped countries, which also generally   have had least of development, or no development, are   particularly hard hit by the oil crisis. To those hardest hit   belong the countries on the Indian subcontinent and also Ceylon   with soon together a total population of one billion, the largest   conglomeration in the world of desperately poor people.</p>
<p>By historical accident, with the oil crisis   was compounded the food crisis. The latter actually preceded it   by about a year. It was caused by bad crops in many parts of the   world and by earlier attempt to decrease the bulging food stocks   in the surplus countries, particularly in the United States but   also Canada and Australia. These stock were expensive to store,   and had up till that time almost made food aid to underdeveloped   countries a not too burdensome policy of agricultural protection,   holding up food prices at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Food prices now advanced suddenly and   rapidly to the great disadvantage of the grain importing   underdeveloped countries and contributed to the inflationary   trend even in the rich countries. We are now anxiously expecting   news about what this year&#8217;s crops will amount to. Any surplus   will partly have to be used for building up stocks again, which   are at a dangerous bottom level.</p>
<p>The oil crisis has had, and has, serious   implications for agricultural production in underdeveloped   countries, particularly but not only by raising the prices for   fertilizers. The technocratic euphoria some ten years ago about a   &#8220;green revolution&#8221; had already earlier been shown up as having   nurtured undue optimism. There are many more reasons, but among   them was also that the new high-yield grains could only be grown   on land with plenty of water and by using much of fertilizers,   which already at the lower prices restricted the favorable impact   of the availability of the new seeds on agricultural   production.</p>
<p>If the present acute food crisis was thus   caused by short-term misfortunes, like droughts or floods and the   increased prices of fertilizers, the reason for long-term   anxieties for the future is primarily the ongoing population   explosion. India, which pioneered attempts to check fertility   earlier than any other country, has as present a population   increase of more than 12 million per year, that is a rate of   around 20 promille. I guess that at present the rate of   population growth is still slightly rising in most underdeveloped   countries.</p>
<p>The unfortunately much confused World   Population Conference in Bucharest last year demonstrated that in   many parts of the underdeveloped world, particularly in Latin   America, Africa and the Middle East, though not in Asia proper,   there is little understanding of what a high population increase   means for keeping down levels of living and for holding back   development in every underdeveloped country. Those effects are   largely independent of how much of underutilized resources a   country disposes of, though, of course, they are more serious in   the already crowded countries. That population increase raises   the demands for a substantial increase in agricultural   production, is obvious.</p>
<p>I cannot in this lecture go deeper into the   population problem but I want to stress, that the difficulties in   bringing down the number of births are tremendous, even for a   country that seriously tries a family planning policy, which   India&#8217;s example demonstrates. A condition for success is that   individual couples among the masses can experience that they are   living in a dynamic society which offers them opportunity to   advance socially and economically. It is not so much the level of   living as such that matters, but whether it is rising. A   comparison between the relative success or failure of family   planning in different underdeveloped countries broadly confirms   this theory.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, a vicious circle   inherent in the present trends. As development is frustrated and   living levels brought downwards among the masses because of the   oil crisis and the food crisis, any population policy, which   might be inaugurated, becomes less effective. And so the food   crisis becomes goaded in the way of circular causation with   cumulative effects.</p>
<p>At a certain stage, which might stretch   over a period of years with its ups and downs, the &#8220;Malthusian   checks&#8221; on the population thrust come into operation. There are   already now regions and groups in underdeveloped countries where   the mortality trend has turned upwards.</p>
<p>But ahead of that point, and thereafter   simultaneously, the morbidity will rise. A growing part of the   poorest strata in a population may be more diseased, or at least   be lacking in vigor, and may even become ever more inflicted,   while the mortality rate is still decreasing, due to the cheap   and powerful medical technology made available after the war.   People will continue to live and breed, only to suffer   debilitating conditions of ill health to an ever larger extent.   Thus, they will be ever less efficient with serious effects also   on the productivity of the labor force.</p>
<p>In this situation there are certainly moral   and rational reasons for a new world order and, to begin with,   for aid on a strikingly much higher level. In particular, people   in the rich countries should be challenged to bring down their   lavish food consumption. It is estimated that if the average   American were to reduce his consumption of beef, pork and poultry   by 10 percent, 12 million tons or more of grain would be saved.   This would mean making so much more food aid possible, saving   perhaps five times as many million people as tons released, or   even more, from starvation in the poorest countries. This   reduction of meat consumption would be in the rational interest   of the American people itself and much less than is recommended   for health reasons by the American Heart Association: one third.   To overeating comes the colossal waste by overserving and   spoilage. To a varying and usually lesser extent the same holds   true in all developed countries.</p>
<p>As has also been amply demonstrated: the   cutting down of consumption, and of production for home   consumption, of many other items besides food, and in all the   developed countries, is rational and in our own interest. This is   what the discussion of the &#8220;quality of life&#8221; is all about. Our   economic growth in a true sense could certainly be continued, but   it should be directed differently, and in a planned way, to serve   our real interest in a better life. At the same time, it would   release resources for aiding the underdeveloped countries on a   much larger scale and to begin with for solving the acute food   crisis.</p>
<p>I am in deep sympathy with the urgings of   medical men, environmentalists and other colleagues in the   natural sciences, when they speak for the rationality in our own   interest, individually and still more collectively, of a much   more frugal life style so far as growth in consumption, and   production for home consumption, of many material products is   concerned. This is what I sincerely mean is in line with our own   welfare as well as our proclaimed ideals.</p>
<p>Real economic planning should be done in   these rational terms. Such planning could help us to be more   successful in solving the internal equality problems and would at   the same time provide for a much larger aid to development in   underdeveloped countries. In the first place, it could prevent   the serious risk of human disasters for the majority of the   poorest peoples in these countries. <i>The blunt truth is that   without rather radical changes in the consumption patterns in the   rich countries, any pious talk about a new world economic order   is humbug.</i></p>
<p>It is legitimate for an economist to   analyze what the rational inferences in regard to economic policy   would be from the value premises of what is in people&#8217;s true   interests and their acclaimed ideals. But if, instead, we raise   the other problem of what is actually going to happen, it is   difficult to believe that these rational policy conclusions are   going to be followed out in the practical policies of developed   countries. In the tradition of Western civilization we are quite   well trained to combine base behavior with high ideals.</p>
<p>The so far very weak reaction on the part   of developed countries to the urgent demand for very much higher   appropriations for aid, directed not upon serving national   interests but upon the needs for aid in the poorest   underdeveloped countries, may be partly explained by these needs   having burst forward and risen at the very time when the   developed countries find themselves in difficulties. They are   commonly experiencing an intensification of the stagflation trend   toward which they were already steering, with unemployment rising   intermittently with continued price inflation. This   intensification of stagflation has been caused by the same oil   crisis and, to an extent, the food crisis, which have been   rendering the situation so utterly precarious for most   underdeveloped countries. One effect is serious balance of   payment difficulties in all developed countries.</p>
<p>This situation is apt to turn policy   interests in developed countries inwards, to the national   problems of how to stop stagflation at home and stabilize the   balance of payments. Those international issues, which are felt   to be important, concern the relations with other developed   countries and with the OPEC countries, while from the point of   view of narrowly conceived national interests what happens in the   underdeveloped countries fades out from serious attention.</p>
<p>And the wider issue referred to above &#8211;   about rational national planning for curtailment of consumption,   and production for home consumption, of such commodities that are   less necessary and often even harmful for health and happiness,   which would also help to stabilize the economy and at the same   time release so much resources for egalitarian reforms within the   countries and between countries &#8211; has less appeal in a situation   of high and, as a trend, rising unemployment. Even normally there   are strong pressure groups defending all sorts of economic   activity that results in incomes in the market. And   indiscriminately supporting all consumption has became a standard   policy means of counteracting unemployment.</p>
<p>Much more generally people keep   conservatively to their consumption habits. They don&#8217;t want to be   reformed, even in their own interest. In our competitive society   all groups are instead always brought to press for more of the   same type of consumption. Commercial marketing does certainly not   work for a more rational discussion of our consumption   demands.</p>
<p>Our politicians, of all political parties,   stick to the inapt concept of &#8220;growth&#8221; which is embodied in the   gross national product or one of its derivatives. We economists,   by not having scrutinized more intensively that even   statistically rather spurious concept, and by ourselves commonly   utilizing &#8220;growth&#8221; in that sense uncritically as a main value   premise in our discussions of practical economic policy, have   unfortunately contributed to restricting the mental horizon of   politicians and of the common people.</p>
<p>It is in this general setting we have to   understand the dawdling and in the end insufficient response in   the developed countries even to patent emergency cases, like that   of the countries south of Sahara, which with their rapidly   increasing population have been experiencing temporary crop   failures, as well as the long time reduction of arable land, as   the desert is advancing by some thirty miles per year. Bangladesh   is in the same emergency situation, having been hit by a sequency   of natural catastrophes and by a cruel and destructive war. And   neither has there been much willingness on the part of developed   countries to enter into firm food aid commitments for other   underdeveloped countries with widespread undernutrition among   their masses in the rural and urban slums. To this category   belongs vast India but also many other, large as well as small   underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p>According to present estimates as many as   10 million people may starve to death this year, and at least   half a billion are hovering on the brink of starvation. It is   against the background of the expectancy of world catastrophes   that the attitudes in developed countries has to be considered in   moral terms. In the United States, where the ideological   discussion is always so much fuller and more outspoken than in   other Western countries, there has in recent years appeared a   rationalization in terms of a pragmatic moral theory, which can   be used, and has been used, not to challenge but to justify our   being so tardy to provide aid and, in particular, food aid to the   poorest countries. This new theory can increasingly be found in   books, articles in learned periodicals like the prestigious   Science as well as popular journals like <i>Newsweek</i>, it is   referred to in the press and propounded at committee hearings in   Congress. Recently it has been endorsed by such a respected   authority as the President of the National Academy of Sciences,   Dr. Philip Handler.</p>
<p>This new theory has introduced the concept   &#8220;triage&#8221; (from the French &#8220;trier&#8221;: to soft), following out an   analogy from the practice in the allied medical tents during the   trench warfare slaughters of World War I. With resources limited,   a distinction had been made between those likely to die no matter   what was done to them, those who would probably recover even if   untreated, and those who would survive if cared for. The third   group alone received attention. The others were left to live, or   to die, on their own.</p>
<p>Based on such an analogy, India is in this   literature commonly counted as belonging to the first group,   which should be left unaided, but also many other very poor   countries. Not giving them food aid is more &#8220;ethical&#8221; so the   argument runs, because those who would be saved will breed, and   in the end still more millions will ultimately be starving and   dying. In the longer run, aid creates more misery than it   alleviates.</p>
<p>The triage theory is not advocating less   aid from the rich countries, only that it be distributed more   wisely by cutting out from consideration those that are helpless.   The new awareness of the poverty in underdeveloped countries, to   which I referred in the beginning of this lecture, is recognized,   and also that poverty among the masses is continually   intensified. Television now brings into our living rooms starving   and dying people, many thousands of miles away. The triage theory   is said to be expounded in order to help us in a &#8220;difficult but   necessary and rational psychological adjustment.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, however, the United   States sells most of its surplus grain commercially to countries   who can afford to pay for it and even to the poorest, like India.   And the United States has actually profited from the rise in food   prices; over the last three years commercial food sales have   grown from $8 to $21 billion, which has been helpful for its   precarious balance of payments. Also most of the food aid has up   till now in the alleged national interest been going to satellite   governments in Southeast Asia, or closely allied governments   elsewhere with only very little to the poorest countries.</p>
<p>The triage theorists do not question this   use of the United States&#8217; surplus grain. The interest to sell   food, and also the severe restrictions on what is made available   as food aid and the direction it is given, is taken for granted   as having been determined by national policy, which is not   criticized. They are merely making the negative point that what   little aid is afforded, should not be given to the very poorest   countries, but that in regard to them &#8220;nature should be left to   take its course&#8221; as the most humanitarian solution.</p>
<p>The argument is often amplified by the   assertion that only such an apparently heartless decision can   bring these countries to force their people to bring down the   birth rate. This shows ignorance about how any policy of family   planning is made even more difficult when development is pointing   towards impoverishing the masses.</p>
<p>That this theory of triage is meeting   strong opposition in America should not surprise. To decide with   god-like finality the death to millions of people goes against   all American moral instincts. <i>The New York Times</i> in a   leading article calls the triage theory &#8220;one of the most   pessimistic and morally threadbare intellectual positions to be   advanced since the demise of the Third Reich.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in order to overcome &#8220;the harsh logic&#8221;   of the triage theory, the United States would have to come   forward with very much more aid, and, indeed, be prepared to   initiate and cooperate in planned intergovernmental action in a   way pointing towards &#8220;a new world order&#8221; asked for by the   underdeveloped countries, which in turn would necessitate the   rational restriction of our lavish utilization of resources. This   consequence the paper does state, but again only in general and   noncommital terms.</p>
<p>This is the moral dilemma which the triage   theory only highlights. And it is a dilemma which faces each of   the developed countries, whether they have surplus food to sell   or give away or not. It would, indeed, assume that the developed   countries began to proceed in the direction of the new rational   planning, I have urged above.</p>
<p>I have hitherto focussed on the food crisis   in terms of the immediate need for aid, in order to prevent, as   far as possible, worsened starvation among the poverty-stricken   masses in underdeveloped countries. But the food crisis is not a   passing worry. In a somewhat longer time perspective, and taking   into account the rapid rise in world population, scarcity of food   must be expected even to get worse, if agricultural production   cannot be steadily and rather speedily increased.</p>
<p>Simplifying matters to the bone, as   repeatedly I have to do in this lecture, and leaving out many   important considerations, such a rise in food production can only   be accomplished, to the extent absolutely needed to avoid a   rising trend of hunger catastrophes, by raising yields   substantially in the under-developed countries themselves. In   developed countries the land resources are already largely   brought under fairly intensive cultivation, so that the prospect   of additional production is limited, and will have to be bought   with rising costs. In underdeveloped countries uncultivated land   is usually also scarce and often becoming scarcer by erosion,   salination and other forms of soil depletion, if it is not   stopped. But apart from this, the yields of cultivated lands are   on the average only roughly one third of what they could be.</p>
<p>It has often been wrongly assumed that   farming in underdeveloped countries is labor intensive, as an   inference from the very large portion of the total labor force   sustained in agriculture &#8211; in India, which is not selfsupporting   in food, about 70 per cent. In fact their farming is extensive.   Too few work at all, those who work do it for too short periods   during the day, week, month and year, and they work too   inefficiently. Part of the explanation is health deficiencies,   and in that respect the acute food crisis by increasing   undernutrition will only make conditions worse, and actually tend   to increase the underutilization of labor and thus decrease the   yields.</p>
<p>Already without any other technology than   what is already known and applied by some of the farmers in a   district, yields could be increased substantially by raising the   labor input and its efficiency. A large part of that labor input   should rationally be directed upon cooperative public work,   improving the land, building more and better roads, constructing   wells, irrigation ditches and storage facilities, and generally   ameliorating the environment for life and work in the   villages.</p>
<p>Modernized technology can make its   contributions by raising the yields still more, though it should   be highly labor-intensive as there is so much underutilized   labor, which has no other place to go than to the rapidly growing   shanty slums in the cities, where labor is equally underutilized.   Totally, the labor force will be increasing annually by more than   two per cent for the next 15-20 years, whatever is happening to   fertility.</p>
<p>But to transfer new technology of that type   to the masses of agriculturalists meets difficulties.   Transferring technology to industry, and, in particular, creating   modern large-scale industry, has proven quite feasible &#8211; at the   price, it is true, of perpetuating the enclave economy typical of   colonial times. It calls for only minimal changes in the   traditional social and political framework in an underdeveloped   country and minimal diffusion of skills throughout the labor   force. It evades direct confrontation with the institutional and   attitudinal obstacles that are holding down economic performance   and perpetuate low levels of labor utilization. Trying to raise   the yields in agriculture through the application of a   modernized, though highly labor-intensive technology, has to   confront the entire style of life in rural society, which often   has become even more inegalitarian and rigid under the pressure   of the population explosion.</p>
<p>Most important is to change &#8220;the relation   between man and land&#8221;, creating the possibilities and the   incentives for man to work more, work harder and more efficiently   and to invest whatever he can lay his hands on to improve the   land, in the first instance by his own labors. There are a number   of auxiliary reforms &#8211; in regard to market organizations,   extension service, credits, etc. &#8211; but without a land reform,   which has been botched in most underdeveloped countries, they   have proved ineffective to reach the masses of   agriculturalists.</p>
<p>And so we face the inequality problem also   within the underdeveloped countries. The fact is, that with few   exceptions and largely independent of the constitutions they are   operating under, these countries are ruled by tiny upper class   elites of different alignments, in some countries, but not all,   having to take some considerations to the &#8220;educated&#8221; middle   class, and sometimes even to organized labor in transport and   large-scale industry, which then tends to become a privileged   class among the workers.</p>
<p>These governing elites in practically all   underdeveloped countries have in general terms explained   themselves in favor of greater equality and, in particular, of   raising the living levels of the poor masses. But in most of   these countries the actual trend has been towards greater   inequality. The fruits of whatever development there has been has   gone to the upper strata, while the lower strata have not seen   much improvement and have often even actually experienced   worsening living and working conditions. This trend has recently   been pushed forward by the combined effects of the population   increase and the oil and food crisis.</p>
<p>Statistics of income distribution, which in   some of these countries, for instance India or Brazil, are not   entirely unreliable, give important information about this   development and illustrate the deprivations the poorest strata   have to live with. But a change of the trend towards a more   egalitarian society cannot be effectuated by a redistribution of   money incomes from the rich to the poor. What the poor masses   need is not a little money, the distribution of which in   countries with so much poverty and with colossal tax avoidance   and tax evasion among the few rich would only spur inflation,   that, in turn, regularly works to the disadvantage of the   poor.</p>
<p>What they do need is fundamental changes in   the conditions under which they are living and working. The   important thing is that these changes regularly imply both   greater equality and increased productivity at the same time. The   two purposes are inextricably joined, much more, in fact, than in   developed countries. To these imperatively needed radical changes   belong, first, land reform, but also a fundamental redirection of   education and health work. And the &#8220;soft state&#8221; must be made   efficient, and corruption, which is now almost everywhere   increasing, must be exterminated on all levels.</p>
<p>The reason for stressing the necessity of   these radical reforms in this lecture is, that they are all   needed for effectuating the fundamental changes of society: which   are a prerequisite for efforts to raise labor utilization and   permit effective application of modernized technology in   agriculture and thereby to increase yields. Beside the   international equality problem, there is a national one.</p>
<p>It could perhaps be expected, that in   developed countries, there should be an eagerness to point to   these problems and to press governments of underdeveloped   countries to initiate reforms. They are all in line with   old-established Western ideals. For a number of reasons, however,   the opposite is true. Any government negotiations with   underdeveloped countries, including those concerning aid, have to   be conducted with their ruling elites. The same is true of all   business relations. Thus developed countries generally come to   strengthen and support the groups who prevent the needed   fundamental reforms, or subvert them to actually be favoring the   not-so-poor, thereby preserving the inegalitarian social and   economic structure. During the cold war, particularly the United   States&#8217; aid and trade became purposely directed upon supporting   reactionary regimes.</p>
<p>When developed countries are so tardy to   increase their aid to underdeveloped countries even in their   present calamitous situation, this must cause a creeping feeling   of guilt on their side. This, in turn, must tend to make them   less prepared to discuss these countries&#8217; lack of will to carry   out the social and economic reform they need in order to avoid a   steady deterioration of their situation, not least in regard to   food production. An exception is, when, as in the case of   Bangladesh, the ineptitude of the government could be pointed to   as an excuse for giving so little aid.</p>
<p>Quite generally, those who feel warmest for   the underdeveloped countries in their present difficulties are   mostly the ones who are least willing to discuss faults and   failures in their policies. This excusing attitude is made the   more possible as the economists, more in earlier years but   largely even now, continue to work with development models   excluding the institutional and political factors.</p>
<p>It has become a convention adhered to by   almost everybody speaking about mankind&#8217;s future, to stress that   all problems are now becoming global, and that they can only be   solved by close collaboration between all governments. The new   economic world order, pressed for by the underdeveloped countries   and as a general proposition accepted by well-wishing persons in   developed countries, sometime even when they represent   governments, is becoming another conventional formula.</p>
<p>As I have stressed, we are, however, far   from giving any reality to these high ideals in the fields   covered in this lecture and I have tried to explain why and   how.</p>
<p>Even outside, and beside the oil crisis,   the food crisis and the population explosion, there are other   imminent pending dangers mounting in the world. The protracted   armaments negotiations have not stopped the armament race between   the superpowers and the increasing militarization of the national   economies in developed as well as underdeveloped countries. The   costs for armaments are calculated to exceed total production in   all the underdeveloped countries taken together. These huge   expenditures most certainly belong to the unnecessary and   exceedingly harmful use of resources I talked about that in a   rational world should be cut down drastically. As the   publications of SIPRI, the independent peace research institute   in Stockholm, has amply demonstrated for such a change the   prospects have rather deteriorated from year to year.</p>
<p>Peace has not come to Southeast Asia or to   the Middle East. Competent observers are expecting that   full-scale wars may again break out, in both cases carrying the   risk of superpower confrontation. The advertised detente has   implied the abstention from grossly abusive language as between   the superpowers, which is all to the good, and some exports from   the United States on favorable terms. But very little else in the   relations between them has been changed much, and the future of   this detente is not assured.</p>
<p>Neither am I hopeful about an early success   in most countries to overcome stagflation. Under these   circumstances the hopes of creating a more stable monetary system   are further from fulfillment than even a few years ago, even if   some more or less satisfactory partial recycling of the oil   revenues could be organized. The efforts to continue the work on   breaking down trade barriers between the developed countries have   gone into an impass, when the most we can hope for is the partial   prevention of a return to the extreme and self-defeating   protectionism of the Thirties.</p>
<p>The continued militarization of the   economies in all countries and the foreseeable failure to create   more normal economic and financial relations in the world are   certainly not promising for any progress in governmental   cooperation for fighting the threatening impoverishment of most   underdeveloped countries which I have been speaking about in this   lecture.</p>
<p>But there are worries beyond and above all   these problems. I am asking myself what has happened to people&#8217;s   moral valuations.</p>
<p>Wars are fought with increasing disrespect   for international law, established for protection of the civilian   population. The illegal, immoral and ruthlessly cruel American   warfare in Southeast Asia has for the time being marked the   culmination of that steeply rising trend from World War I and on.   There are terror activities by organized groups, endorsed by some   governments and meeting no effective protest by other   governments.</p>
<p>Torture has become a regular police   practice in an increasing number of countries. In almost all   countries there is an increase of violence and crime. The   spreading use of drugs, which was not a serious problem a few   decades ago, has, as we know, in various ways been a direct cause   of increased violence and crimes, and represents by itself an   increase of antisocial lawlessness.</p>
<p>A heightened awareness of these   developments is pressed upon everybody because of the   tremendously more effective communications. By watching   television, the broad strata of the American public saw the   horrors created by their own government in Vietnam. Too many did   not protest, and many more are now trying to live on and   forget.</p>
<p>To what extent is the result of all this   that we are becoming less morally sensitive? Has it blunted our   feelings of human compassion and thus made us more prone to   opportunistic indifference? If so, this is also part of the   explanation a people&#8217;s coldbloodedness when facing the problems   of sufferings and deaths in the poorest countries, hit by the   effects of the oil crisis, the food crisis and the population   explosion.</p>
<p>Quite apart from such an enlargement of our   perception of those world problems, which I have tried to analyze   in this lecture, these problems are in themselves immensely   complicated. As an institutional economist, compelled to conceive   of development as a movement of a whole political, social and   economic system and having tried to deal with the problems in a   world setting, I have had to express judgments on a very wide   variety of human conditions. Although I have put labor into   basing these judgments upon a more intensive realistic study than   I can account for in this lecture, most of them remain tentative   and anyhow far from being certain, exact and precise.</p>
<p>This is not my fault but is due, first, to   the fact that many of the conditions I have been speaking of are   difficult already to define appropriately, and the further fact   that the coefficients of interrelations between all changes of   conditions within the system are very seldom known with   quantitative precision. The analyst is left to use whatever   knowledge he can acquire, even if it is not in the precise form   that economists have been trying to attain. When dealing with   wider issues they often achieve it by limiting the scope of   inquiry. This, of course, only makes the analysis less relevant,   adequate and realistic, particularly in the present world   tumult.</p>
<p>Even though my world view must be gloomy, I   am hopeful about the development of our science. We can by   immanent criticism in logical terms challenge our own thinking   and cleanse it from opportunistic conformism. And we can widen   our perspective. Everything can be studied. We are free to expand   and perfect our knowledge about the world, only restricted by the   number of scientists working and, of course, the degree of their   diligence, brightness and their openness to fresh approaches.</p>
