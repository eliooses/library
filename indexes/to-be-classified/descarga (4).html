<p class="smalltext">Lecture to the memory of Alfred Nobel,   December 8, 1987</p>
<h2>Growth Theory and After</h2>
<p>I have been told that everybody has dreams,   but that some people habitually forget them even before they wake   up. That seems to be what happens to me. So I do not know if I   have ever dreamt about giving this Lecture. I know that I have   been in this room before, but that was in real life, and I was   awake. If I have given this lecture in my dreams, there is no   doubt that the topic was the theory of economic growth. I am told   that the subject of the lecture should be &#8220;on or associated with   the work for which the Prize was awarded.&#8221; That is pretty   unambiguous. But I would not even wish to use the leeway offered   by the phrase &#8220;associated with.&#8221; Growth theory is exactly what I   want to talk about: for itself, for its achievements, for the   gaps that remain to be filled, and also as a vehicle for some   thoughts about the nature of theoretical research in   macroeconomics, and empirical research as well.</p>
<p>Growth theory did not begin with my   articles of 1956 and 1957, and it certainly did not end there.   Maybe it began with <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>; and probably   even Adam Smith had predecessors. More to the point, in the 1950s   I was following a trail that had been marked out by Roy Harrod   and by Evsey Domar, and also by Arthur Lewis in a slightly   different context. Actually I was trying to track down and   relieve a certain discomfort that I felt with their work. I shall   try to explain what I mean in a few words.</p>
<p>Harrod and Domar seemed to be answering a   straightforward question: when is an economy capable of steady   growth at a constant rate? They arrived by noticeably different   routes, at a classically simple answer: the national saving rate   (the fraction of income saved) has to be equal to the product of   the capital-output ratio and the rate of growth of the   (effective) labor force. Then and only then could the economy   keep its stock of plant and equipment in balance with its supply   of labor, so that steady growth could go on without the   appearance of labor shortage on one side or labor surplus and   growing unemployment on the other side. They were right about   that general conclusion.</p>
<p>Discomfort arose because they worked this   out on the assumption that all three of the key ingredients &#8211; the   saving rate, the rate of growth of the labor force, and the   capital-output ratio &#8211; were given constants, facts of nature. The   saving rate was a fact about preferences; the growth rate of   labor supply was a demographic-sociological fact; the   capital-output ratio was a technological fact.</p>
<p>All of them were understood to be capable   of changing from time to time, but sporadically and more or less   independently. In that case, however, the possibility of steady   growth would be a miraculous stroke of luck. Most economies, most   of the time, would have no equilibrium growth path. The history   of capitalist economies should be an alternation of long periods   of worsening unemployment and long periods of worsening labor   shortage.</p>
<p>The theory actually suggested something   even more dramatic. Harrod&#8217;s writings, especially, were full of   incompletely worked out claims that steady growth was in any case   a very unstable sort of equilibrium: any little departure from it   would be magnified indefinitely by a process that seemed to   depend mainly on vague generalizations about entrepreneurial   behavior. You may remember that John Hicks&#8217;s <i>Trade Cycle</i>   book, which was based on Harrod&#8217;s growth model, needed to invoke   a full employment ceiling to generate downturns and a   zero-gross-investment floor to generate upturns. Otherwise the   model economy would have run away.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Harrod&#8217;s first   <i>Essay</i> was published in 1939 and Domar&#8217;s first article in   1946. Growth theory, like much else in macroeconomics, was a   product of the depression of the 1930s and of the war that   finally ended it. So was I. Nevertheless it seemed to me that the   story told by these models felt wrong. An expedition from Mars   arriving on Earth having read this literature would have expected   to find only the wreckage of a capitalism that had shaken itself   to pieces long ago. Economic history was indeed a record of   fluctuations as well as of growth, but most business cycles   seemed to be self-limiting. Sustained, though disturbed, growth   was not a rarity.</p>
<p>There was another implication of the   Harrod-Domar model that seemed unsound. If the condition for   steady growth is that the savings rate equal the product of the   growth rate of employment and a technologically-determined   capital-output ratio, then a recipe for doubling the rate of   growth in a labor surplus economy was simply to double the savings   rate, perhaps through the public budget. Well, not <i>simply</i>:   we all knew then &#8211; as I am not sure we all know now &#8211; that   doubling the <i>ex ante</i> saving rate would not double the   <i>ex post</i> saving rate unless something were taking care of   the <i>ex ante</i> investment rate at the same time. (I hope   these strange Latin phrases are still understood in Stockholm in   1987!) In underdeveloped countries, however, where the appetite   for new capital is likely to be pretty strong, the recipe looked   usable. I believe I remember that writings on economic   development often asserted that the key to a transition from slow   growth to fast growth was a sustained rise in the savings rate.   The recipe sounded implausible to me. I can no longer remember   exactly why, but it did.</p>
<p>That was the spirit in which I began   tinkering with the theory of economic growth, trying to improve   on the Harrod-Domar model. I can not tell you why I thought first   about replacing the constant capital-output (and labor-output)   ratio by a richer and more realistic representation of the   technology. I know that even as a student I was drawn to the   theory of production rather than to the formally almost identical   theory of consumer choice. It seemed more down to earth. I know   that it occurred to me very early, as a natural-born   macroeconomist, that even if technology itself is not so very   flexible for each single good at a given time, aggregate   factor-intensity must be much more variable because the economy   can choose to focus on capital-intensive or labor-intensive or   land-intensive goods. Anyway, I found something interesting right   away.</p>
<p>It would sound silly for me to explain in   any detail to this audience what I found. Nearly everyone who   spends any time in this room already knows. The &#8220;neoclassical   model of economic growth&#8221; started a small industry. It stimulated   hundreds of theoretical and empirical articles by other   economists. It very quickly found its way into textbooks and into   the fund of common knowledge of the profession. Indeed that is   what allows me to think that I am a respectable person to be   giving this lecture today. Nevertheless I must summarize the   outcome in a couple of sentences, so that I can move on to the   more interesting questions about what is still unknown or   uncertain and remains to be found out.</p>
<p>Just allowing for a reasonable degree of   technological flexibility accomplished two things. In the first   place, the mere existence of a feasible path of steady growth   turned out not to be a singular event. A range of steady states   is possible, and the range may even be quite wide if the range of   aggregative factor-intensities is wide. There are other ways in   which an economy can adapt to the Harrod-Domar condition, but it   still seems to me that variation in capital-intensity is probably   the most important.</p>
<p>Secondly, it turned out to be an   implication of diminishing returns that the equilibrium rate of   growth is not only not proportional to the saving (investment)   rate, but is independent of the saving (investment) rate. A   developing economy that succeeds in permanently increasing its   saving (investment) rate will have a higher level of output than   if it had not done so, and must therefore grow faster for a   while. But it will not achieve a permanently higher rate of   growth of output. More precisely: the permanent rate of growth of   output per unit of labor input is independent of the saving   (investment) rate and depends entirely on the rate of   technological progress in the broadest sense.</p>
<p>There was a third result that seemed useful   and certainly helped to make the model appealing to economists.   Earlier growth theory was mechanical or physical, not in any bad   sense but in the sense that it was almost entirely a description   of flows and stocks of goods. In the neoclassical model it was   quite natural and practical to describe <i>equilibrium</i> paths   and to work out the price and interest rate dynamics that would   support an equilibrium path. It did not occur to me the time that   in doing this I was bringing good news and bad news. The good   news was that economists instinctively like to think that way,   and the connection would help to get my professional colleagues   interested in growth theory. Moreover, it is a good (that is,   fruitful) instinct, whether one is dealing with a capitalist or a   socialist economy. The bad news is that the connection is a bit   too pretty and too interesting and unleashes a standing   temptation to sound like Dr. Pangloss, a very clever Dr.   Pangloss. I think that tendency has won out in recent years, as I   shall try to explain later on, though it may be too late for me   to pretend to be Candide.</p>
<p>When I look back now at the articles I   wrote in the 1950s and 1960s on this general subject, I am struck   and even a little surprised at how much effort went into   broadening the technological framework of growth theory. I wanted   to make sure that the model could accommodate the likelihood that   new technology can only be introduced with the use of newly   designed and produced capital equipment, that factor proportions   might be variable only at the instant of gross investment and not   after capital equipment had taken some particular form, and that   enough flexibility could be achieved with discrete activities,   even with only one activity so long as the length of life of   capital goods could be chosen economically. And in every case I   wanted to show that the appropriate commodity-price-factor-price   relations could be worked out and made intelligible in terms of   the inherited instincts of economists. (In my case I had   inherited them mainly from Knut Wicksell and Paul Samuelson.)</p>
<p>There were reasons for this special   orientation, reasons that seemed pretty compelling at the time.   In the first place, it was the introduction of some technological   flexibility that had opened up growth theory to a wider variety   of real-world facts and to a closer connection with general   economic theory. It seemed important to make sure that these   gains were not tied too closely to an indefensibly simple version   of factor substitution. Secondly, I had already begun to do some   empirical work making use of an aggregate production function   with apparently meaningful and clearly surprising results. I was   very skeptical about this device myself, and I knew that others   would have doubts of their own. It seemed like a good idea to   make sure that the method was capable, at least in principle, of   dealing with the first few doses of realism. And, thirdly, I was   already trapped in the famous &#8220;Cambridge controversy&#8221;. I use the   word &#8220;trapped&#8221; because that whole episode now seems to me to have   been a waste of time, a playing-out of ideological games in the   language of analytical economics. At the time I thought &#8211; and the   literature gave some reason to think &#8211; that part of the argument   was about marginalism, about smooth marginalism. So I wanted to   be able to show that the conclusions of the theory and of its   empirical implementation were not bound to that very special   formulation. I guess it was worth doing, but it certainly did not   pacify anyone.</p>
<p>There was one bad by-product of this focus   on the description of technology. I think I paid too little   attention to the problems of effective demand. To put it   differently: a theory of equilibrium growth badly needed &#8211; and   still needs &#8211; a theory of deviations from the equilibrium growth   path. I can honestly say that I realized the need at the time.   There is a brief section at the end of my 1956 article that deals   in a perfunctory way with the implications of real-wage rigidity   and with the possibility of a liquidity trap. That was just a   lick and a promise. There was also a paragraph that I am prouder   of: it made the point that growth theory provides a framework   within which one can seriously discuss macroeconomic policies   that not only achieve and maintain full employment but also make   a deliberate choice between current consumption and current   investment, and therefore between current consumption and future   consumption. Only a few years later I had the memorable   experience in the Kennedy-Heller Council of Economic Advisers of   seeing those ideas written into the 1962 <i>Economic Report</i>   (which is about to be republished by the MIT Press). The history   of the past seven years in the United States suggests that the   lesson has not yet been learned in Washington.</p>
<p>The problem of combining long-run and   short-run macroeconomics has still not been solved. I will come   back to it later on. This is the place for me to confess to (and   explain away) a certain youthful confusion. In the early   discussions of Harrod-Domar growth theory there was much talk   about the intrinsic instability of equilibrium growth.   &#8220;Instability&#8221; could and did mean two different things, and the   meanings were not always clearly distinguished. It could mean   that well-behaved equilibrium paths are surrounded by   badly-behaved equilibrium paths, so that a small sideward step   could lead to eventual disaster. Or it could mean that   instability applies to disequilibrium behavior, so that an   economy that once strays from equilibrium growth would not   automatically find its way back to <i>any</i> equilibrium growth   path.</p>
<p>The original Harrod-Domar model seemed to   be subject to both these difficulties. I think I showed that   extension of the model took the sting out of the first sort of   instability. The second sort, however, really does involve the   integration of short-run and long-run macroeconomics, of growth   theory and business-cycle theory. Harrod and many contemporary   commentators went at this problem by making very special (and   unconvincing) assumptions about investment behavior. I may not   have been as clear then as I am now about the distinction between   the two notions of instability. Today I would put the unsolved   problem as follows. One of the achievements of growth theory was   to relate equilibrium growth to asset pricing under tranquil   conditions. The hard part of disequilibrium growth is that we do   not have-and it may be impossible to have-a really good theory of   asset valuation under turbulent conditions. (1987 is an excellent   year in which to make that observation!)</p>
<p>One important tendency in contemporary   macroeconomic theory evades this problem in an elegant but (to   me) ultimately implausible way. The idea is to imagine that the   economy is populated by a single immortal consumer, or a number   of identical immortal consumers. The immortality itself is not a   problem: each consumer could be replaced by a dynasty, each   member of which treats her successors as extensions of herself.   But no short-sightedness can be allowed. This consumer does not   obey any simple short-run saving function, nor even a stylized   Modigliani life-cycle rule of thumb. Instead she, or the dynasty,   is supposed to solve an infinite-time utility-maximization   problem. That strikes me as far-fetched, but not so awful that   one would not want to know where the assumption leads.</p>
<p>The next step is harder to swallow in   conjunction with the first. For this consumer every firm is just   a transparent instrumentality, an intermediary, a device for   carrying out intertemporal optimization subject only to   technological constraints and initial endowments. Thus any kind   of market failure is ruled out from the beginning, by assumption.   There are no strategic complementarities, no coordination   failures, no prisoners&#8217; dilemmas.</p>
<p>The end result is a construction in which   the whole economy is assumed to be solving a Ramsey   optimal-growth problem through time, disturbed only by stationary   stochastic shocks to tastes and technology. To these the economy   adapts optimally. Inseparable from this habit of thought is the   automatic presumption that observed paths are equilibrium paths.   So we are asked to regard the construction I have just described   as a model of the actual capitalist world. What we used to call   business cycles &#8211; or at least booms and recessions are now to be   interpreted as optimal blips in optimal paths in response to   random fluctuations in productivity and the desire for   leisure.</p>
<p>I find none of this convincing. The markets   for goods and for labor look to me like imperfect pieces of   social machinery with important institutional peculiarities. They   do not seem to behave at all like transparent and frictionless   mechanisms for converting the consumption and leisure desires of   households into production and employment decisions. I can not   imagine shocks to taste and technology large enough on a   quarterly or annual time scale to be responsible for the ups and   downs of the business cycle. But now I have to report something   disconcerting. I can refer you to an able, civilized and   completely serious example of this approach and suggest that you   will find it very hard to refute. You can find non-trivial   objections to important steps in the argument, but that would be   true of any powerful macroeconomic model.</p>
<p>There is a dilemma here. When I say that   Prescott&#8217;s story is hard to refute, it does not follow that his   case can be proved. Quite the contrary: there are other models,   inconsistent with his, that are just as hard to refute, maybe   harder. The conclusion must be that historical time series do not   provide a critical experiment. This is where a chemist would move   into the laboratory, to design and conduct just such an   experiment. That option is not available to economists. My   tentative resolution of the dilemma is that we have no choice but   to take seriously our own direct observations of the way economic   institutions work. There will, of course, be arguments about the   <i>modus operandi</i> of different institutions, but there is no   reason why they should not be intelligible, orderly, fact-bound   arguments. This sort of methodological opportunism can be   uncomfortable and unsettling; but at least it should be able to   protect us from foolishness.</p>
<p>Since what I have just said goes against   the spirit of the times, I would like to be very explicit. No one   could be against time-series econometrics. When we need estimates   of parameters, for prediction or policy analysis, there is no   good alternative to the specification and estimation of a model.   To leave it at that, however, to believe as many American   economists do that empirical economics begins and ends with time   series analysis, is to ignore a lot of valuable information that   can not be put into so convenient a form. I include the sort of   information that is encapsulated in the qualitative inferences   made by expert observers, as well as direct knowledge of the   functioning of economic institutions. Skepticism is always in   order, of course. Insiders are sometimes the slaves of silly   ideas. But we are not so well off for evidence that we can afford   to ignore everything but time series of prices and   quantities.</p>
<p>After this methodological digression, I   should remind you of the direction of my main argument. Growth   theory was invented to provide a systematic way to talk about and   to compare equilibrium paths for the economy. In that task it   succeeded reasonably well. In doing so, however, it failed to   come to grips adequately with an equally important and   interesting problem: the right way to deal with deviations from   equilibrium growth. One possible solution strikes me as   wrong-headed: that is to deny the existence of an analytical   problem by claiming that &#8220;economic fluctuations&#8221; are not   deviations from equilibrium growth at all, but examples of   equilibrium growth. My impression is that belief in this story is   more or less confined to North America. Maybe the experiences of   European economies does not lend itself to this interpretation at   all. What alternatives are there?</p>
<p>It will not do simply to superimpose your   favorite model of the business cycle on an equilibrium growth   path. That might do for very small deviations, more in the nature   of minor slightly autocorrelated &#8220;errors.&#8221; But if one looks at   substantial more-than-quarterly departures from equilibrium   growth, as suggested for instance by the history of the large   European economies since 1979, it is impossible to believe that   the equilibrium growth path itself is unaffected by the short- to   medium-run experience. In particular the amount and directions of   capital formation is bound to be affected by the business cycle,   whether through gross investment in new equipment or through the   accelerated scrapping of old equipment. I am also inclined to   believe that the segmentation of the labor market by occupation,   industry and region, with varying amounts of unemployment from   one segment to another, will also react back on the equilibrium   path. So a simultaneous analysis of trend and fluctuations really   does involve an integration of long-run and short-run, or   equilibrium and disequilibrium.</p>
<p>The simplest strategy is a familiar one   from other contexts. In a completely aggregated growth model the   relevant prices are the real wage and real rate of interest.   Suppose they are both rigid, or merely adjust very slowly to   excess supplies in the markets for labor and goods. (The more   usual assumption is that only the wage is sticky; but in   Wicksell&#8217;s own native habitat we should allow for a divergence   between the &#8220;natural&#8221; and &#8220;market&#8221; rates of interest.) Then the   economy may be away from any full equilibrium path for a long   time. During that time its evolution will be governed by a   short-run dynamics much like everyday business-cycle theory.</p>
<p>The most interesting case to consider is   one where real wage and rate of interest are stuck at levels that   lead to excess supply of labor and goods (saving greater than   investment ex ante). This is the sort of configuration we have   come to call &#8220;Keynesian.&#8221; The big difference is that net   investment may be positive or negative; industrial capacity may   be rising or falling. The economy may eventually return to an   equilibrium path, perhaps because &#8220;prices are flexible in the   long run&#8221; as we keep telling ourselves. If and when it does, it   will not return to the continuation of the equilibrium path it   was on before it slipped off. The new equilibrium path will   depend on the amount of capital accumulation that has taken place   during the period of disequilibrium, and probably also on the   amount of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, that   has been experienced. Even the level of technology may be   different, if technological change is endogenous rather than   arbitrary.</p>
<p>This is the sort of amendment that I   mentioned in 1956, but did not pursue very far. There is now an   excellent exploratory sketch by Edmond Malinvaud using this   fix-price approach to growth theory. As you would expect, an   important role is played by the investment function. When I   referred earlier on to the difficult problem of asset valuation   away from an equilibrium path, this is what I meant. We are   reduced to some more or less plausible formulation guided by more   or less robust econometric results and by whatever we think we   know about investment decision-making in real firms. Malinvaud   emphasizes &#8220;profitability&#8221; as a determinant of investment, but he   also emphasizes that the precise meaning of profitability is   unclear whenever the future is unclear.</p>
<p>The main result of Malinvaud&#8217;s analysis is   a clarification of the condition under which a &#8220;Keynesian&#8221; steady   state is possible, and when it is locally stable, i. e. when it   will be approached by an economy disturbed from a nearby   equilibrium path. The unstable case is just as interesting,   because it suggests the possibility of small causes having big   results. All these stability arguments have to be tentative   because the interest rate and real wage are assumed to be fixed   while quantities move. That is not an adequate reason to dismiss   the results in a purist spirit; but obviously the research   program is not complete.</p>
<p>A sketch by Malinvaud is as good as a book   by someone else. My own inclination &#8211; it is just an inclination &#8211;   is to try a slightly different slant. Thinking about the   ambiguousness of the concept of profitability and its relation to   investment reminds one that many firms react to changed   circumstances precisely by changing their prices. The obvious   alternative to a model with sticky prices is a model with   imperfectly competitive price-setting firms. Then, of course, one   can no longer speak in any simple way of excess supply of goods.   But we can find something just as interesting; the possibility of   many coexisting equilibrium paths, some of which are   unambiguously better than others. (Usually the better ones have   higher output and employment than the worse ones, so something   like recession makes an appearance anyway.) The interaction of   growth and business cycle can then take a slightly different   form: alternation of good and bad equilibria is not just a simple   averaging.)</p>
<p>This sort of model is now pretty familiar   in a static context, where it can make good working sense of the   notion of &#8220;effective demand.&#8221; Firms will naturally condition   their actions on beliefs about economic aggregates. Frank Hahn   and I are working on extending it to a model of overlapping   generations, so that it would be easy to convert any stationary   equilibrium state into a growing steady state. Preliminary   indications are that the thing can be done. There is a hope,   therefore, that either the fix-price approach or the   imperfect-competition approach can allow us to talk sensibly about   macroeconomic policy in a growth context.</p>
<p>In my 1956 paper there was already a brief   indication of the way neutral technological progress could be   incorporated into a model of equilibrium growth. It was a   necessary addition because otherwise the only steady states of   the model would have constant income per person and that could   hardly be a valid picture of industrial capitalism. Technological   progress, very broadly defined to include improvements in the   human factor, was necessary to allow long-run growth in real   wages and the standard of living. Since an aggregate production   function was already part of the model, it was natural to think   of estimating it from long-run time series for a real economy.   That plus a few standard parameters &#8211; like saving rate and   population growth &#8211; would make the model operational.</p>
<p>Estimating an aggregate production function   was hardly a new idea, but I did have a new wrinkle in mind: to   use observed factor prices as indicators of current marginal   productivities, so that each observation would give me not only   an approximate point on the production function but also an   approximate indication of its slopes. I am pretty sure that this   idea was suggested to me by equilibrium growth theory. I want to   emphasize that I did not then have any notion I was doing   something intensely controversial.</p>
<p>The first few paragraphs of my 1957 article   are thoroughly ambivalent, not about the method but about the use   of aggregate data on inputs and output. After expressing my   doubts I went ahead in a pragmatic spirit. One can not do   macroeconomics without aggregative relationships; and at least   for the moment there is no substitute for macroeconomics. The   only way I can account for the intensity of controversy over this   point is to ascribe it to the belief that there is something   intrinsically ideological about the notion that profits on   &#8220;capital&#8221; represents the return to a factor of production as   imputed by the market. John Bates Clark may have thought, a   century ago, that distribution according to marginal products was   &#8220;just&#8221; but no modern economist, no modern &#8220;bourgeois&#8221; economist,   would accept that reasoning.</p>
<p>Anyway, the main result of that 1957   exercise was startling. Gross output per hour of work in the U.   S. economy doubled between 1909 and 1949; and some seven-eighths   of that increase could be attributed to &#8220;technical change in the   broadest sense&#8221; and only the remaining eight could be attributed   to conventional increase in capital intensity. Actually Solomon   Fabricant at the National Bureau of Economic Research had come up   with a similar breakdown for a slightly earlier period, using   methods with less in the way of analytic foundation. I think I   had expected to find a larger role for straightforward capital   formation than I actually found; I will come back to that point   soon.</p>
<p>The broad conclusion has held up   surprisingly well in the thirty years since then during which   time &#8220;growth accounting&#8221; has been refined quite a lot, especially   by Edward Denison. The main refinement has been to unpack   &#8220;technical progress in the broadest sense&#8221; into a number of   constituents of which various human-capital variables and   &#8220;technological change in the narrow sense&#8221; are the most   important. To give you an idea of the current state of play I   shall quote Denison&#8217;s most recent estimates for the United   States.</p>
<p>Taking the period from 1929 to 1982 and   smoothing away the business cycle, he finds that the real   non-residential business output increased at an average rate of   3.1 percent a year. The problem now is to parcel this out among a   number of basic determinants of growth. Denison estimates that a   quarter of it can be attributed to increased labor input of   constant educational level. Another 16 percent (i.e. about 1/2   percent a year) is credited to the increased educational   qualifications of the average worker. The growth of &#8220;capital&#8221;   accounts for 12 percent of the growth of output; this is   coincidentally almost exactly what I found for 1909-1949 using my   original method, of which Denison&#8217;s is in some ways a practical   refinement. Then Denison imputes 11 percent of total growth to   &#8220;improved allocation of resources&#8221; (by which he means such things   as the movement of labor from low-productivity agriculture to   higher productivity industry). Another 11 percent goes to   &#8220;economies of scale&#8221; (but this must be a very insecure   imputation). Finally 34 % of recorded growth is credited to &#8220;the   growth of knowledge&#8221; or technological progress in the narrow   sense. If you add up these percentages, you will see that Denison   has accounted for 109 percent of measured growth. Miscellaneous   factors must then have reduced the growth of output by nine   percent of 3.1 percent, or just under 0.3 percent a year. (These   negative factors could include such things as investment in   environmental improvement, which uses resources but does not   appear in measured output, though it may of course be very   valuable.)</p>
<p>This detailed accounting is an improvement   on my first attempt, but it leads to roughly the same conclusion.   Remember that I distinguished only three factors: straight labor,   straight capital, and residual &#8220;technical change&#8221;. Denison   decomposes the residual into five components, but the flavor is   very similar.</p>
<p>The similarity is brought out more strongly   if one looks at Denison&#8217;s results on a &#8220;per person employed&#8221;   basis. Real output per person employed grew by 1.7 percent per   year between 1929 and 1982. Labor input per person employed   accounted for &#8211; 23 percent of this. That sounds strange; but   means mostly that hours worked per year per person employed fell   during the period, so that the average employed person provided   less straight labor time. I will not go over the full imputation.   All I want to point out is that education per worker accounts for   30 percent of the increase in output per worker and the advance   of knowledge accounts for 64 percent in Denison&#8217;s figures. Thus   technology remains the dominant engine of growth, with human   capital investment in second place. One does not have to believe   in the accuracy of these numbers; the message they transmit is   pretty clear anyway.</p>
<p>That is meant as a serious remark. If I may   revert to methodological propaganda again, I would like to remind   my colleagues and their readers that every piece of empirical   economics rests on a substructure of background assumptions that   are probably not quite true. For instance, these   total-factor-productivity calculations require not only that   market prices can serve as a rough and ready approximation of   marginal products, but that aggregation does not hopelessly   distort these relationships. Under those circumstances,   robustness should be the supreme econometric virtue; and   over-interpretation is the endemic econometric vice. So I would   be happy if you were to accept that the results I have been   quoting point to a qualitative truth and give perhaps some guide   to orders of magnitude. To ask for much more than that is to ask   for trouble. I would also like to quote the profound warning   issued by the leading student of the statistics of baseball &#8211; it   hangs in my office &#8211; &#8220;No amount of (apparent) statistical   evidence will make a statement invulnerable to common sense&#8221;.</p>
<p>The mention of common sense brings to mind   another aspect of this story, still unsettled in the literature.   In the beginning, I was quite surprised at the relatively minor   part the model ascribed to capital formation. Even when this was   confirmed by Denison and others, the result seemed contrary to   common sense. The fact that the steady-state rate of growth is   independent of the investment quota was easy to understand; it   only required thinking through the theory. It was harder to feel   comfortable with the conclusion that even in the shorter run   increased investment would do very little for transitory growth.   The transition to a higher equilibrium growth path seemed to   offer very little leverage for policy aimed at promoting   investment.</p>
<p>The formal model omitted one mechanism   whose absence would clearly bias the predictions against   investment. That is what I called &#8220;embodiment&#8221;, the fact that   much technological progress, maybe most of it, could find its way   into actual production only with the use of new and different   capital equipment. Therefore the effectiveness of innovation in   increasing output would be paced by the rate of gross investment.   A policy to increase investment would thus lead not only to   higher capital intensity, which might not matter much, but also   to a faster transfer of new technology into actual production,   which would. Steady-state growth would not be affected, but   intermediate-run transitions would, and those should be   observable.</p>
<p>That idea seemed to correspond to common   sense, and it still does. By 1958 I was able to produce a model   that allowed for the embodiment effect. A certain amount of   simplicity was lost, because the stock of capital could no longer   be regarded as a homogenous lump. One had to keep track of its   age structure; but that was precisely the point. Anyhow the model   was workable even if it was not neat. If common sense was right,   the embodiment model should have fit the facts significantly   better than the earlier one. But it did not. Denison, whose   judgment I respect, came to the conclusion that there was no   explanatory value in the embodiment idea. I do not know if that   finding should be described as a paradox, but it was at least a   puzzle.</p>
<p>In the course of preparing this lecture, I   came across a recent working paper by Professor Edward N. Wolff   (of New York University) which offers a longer-run perspective on   this matter. Wolff compiled data for seven large countries   (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and   the United States) covering the whole century from 1880 to 1979.   He also paid special attention to the postwar period 1950-79.   These particular countries were selected for data availability   only, so they can not be considered a representative sample.   Wolff&#8217;s result is therefore only suggestive, but it is an   interesting suggestion.</p>
<p>For each of the countries he calculates the   average growth rate of Total Factor Productivity (i.e., what I   have called the rate of technical progress in the broad sense)   and also various measures of the speed of investment. (For   instance he looks at the growth rate of the capital stock, the   growth rate of the capital-labor ratio, and the average   investment quota itself.) Then, looking across countries, he   finds a very strong positive correlation between the rate of   technical progress and the speed of investment. His   interpretation is that this provides strong confirmation of the   embodiment hypothesis: if we suppose that all these countries had   access to roughly the same pool of technological innovations,   then it appears that the ones that invested fastest were best   able to take advantage of the available knowledge. That is   certainly one reasonable interpretation and it is one I like.   Keep in mind that, by using total factor productivity, Wolff has   already &#8220;given&#8221; to investment its traditional function of   increasing productivity by increasing capital intensity, so the   remaining correlation is between investment and the <i>shift</i>   of the aggregate production function.</p>
<p>To be faithful to my own methodological   precepts, however, I should remind you that other interpretations   are also possible. For example, it could be the case that some   countries are better able to exploit the common pool of   technological progress than others, for reasons that have nothing   to do with the rate of capital formation; but in exactly those   technologically progressive countries investment is most   profitable, so naturally the rate of investment is higher. Or   else rapid technical progress <i>and</i> high investment could   both be the result of some third factor, like the presence of   conditions that encourage entrepreneurial activity. High   investment and fast technical progress will then go together.</p>
<p>I can not argue strongly one way or the   other. But at least the way remains open for a reasonable person   to believe that the stimulation of investment will favor faster   intermediate-run growth through its effect on the transfer of   technology from laboratory to factory.</p>
<p>Before I finish, perhaps I should point out   that it is possible to combine most of the building-blocks I have   been discussing in a small but fairly complete econometric model.   If that were not possible, I would find the ideas less   interesting. It has in fact been done. One example is the &#8220;annual   growth model of the U.S. economy&#8221; due to Bert Hickman and Robert   Coen.</p>
<p>This is a model whose production side is   completely aggregated and is, in fact, just exactly the sort of   thing I have been talking about. (The demand side is   disaggregated, but that is not important now.) The full   equilibrium paths of the Hickman-Coen model are exactly those   made familiar by growth theory, a little more general because the   determination of saving and the evolution of the labor force are   looked after in more detail.</p>
<p>That part is quite straightforward. In some   recent exercises, however, Hickman and Coen have started a   serious study of deviations from equilibrium growth in exactly   the spirit recommended by Malinvaud and by me. They allow for   real wage rigidity, and they model their producing sector as a   price-setting monopolistic competitor. Now investment does not   have to be equal to full-employment saving, except in full   equilibrium. Periods of boom and stagnation can appear, and do   appear, to almost no one&#8217;s surprise. There can be &#8220;Keynesian&#8221; and   &#8220;classical&#8221; unemployment. Indeed there can be both at the same   time: the real wage might be too high to allow full employment   with existing capital stock, while at the same time aggregate   demand is inadequate to take off the market what firms would wish   to produce. Changes in the real wage could have demand-side and   supply-side effects.</p>
<p>All this sounds very good, sounds just like   the macroeconomics that pragmatic Americans and Swedes have   practiced all along. I can not vouch for the Hickman numbers, but   they are at least sensible. They show, by the way, that   high-real-wage induced unemployment was negligible in the U.S.   between 1959 and 1978, and was then again dwarfed by low-demand   induced unemployment in 1981 and 1982. I do not know what their   story is for the years after 1982, but the fact that I would like   to know speaks well for the model.</p>
<p>In this brief review of the goals and   achievements of growth theory I have referred as much to the work   of others as to my own. That is more than mere modesty: the   choice reflects my belief that any successful line of economic   analysis is almost certain to be a group product. We attach names   to ideas for good and bad reasons, but useful ideas are usually   worked out and critically refined by a research community. I have   some faith that the ideas of &#8220;neoclassical&#8221; growth theory are   viable just because they have attracted a research community,   even a rather diverse community: Lucas and Prescott build on the   basic model, and so do Malinvaud and &#8220;sunspot&#8221; theorists like   Karl Shell and others.</p>
<p>When I read Robert Frost&#8217;s lines from &#8220;The   Black Cottage&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="quote">Most of the change we think we see in     life<br />     is due to truths being in and out of favor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it occurred to me at once that they sound   altogether too much like economics. Some of that feeling is   inevitable, and not necessarily to be regretted. The permanent   substructure of applicable economics can not be too very large   because social institutions and social norms evolve, and the   characteristics of economic behavior will surely evolve with   them. I believe also that part of the changeability of economic   ideas on a shorter time-scale is our own doing. It comes from   trying too hard, pushing too far, asking ever more refined   questions of limited data, over-fitting our models and   over-interpreting the results. This, too, is probably inevitable   and not especially to be regretted. You never know if you have   gone as far as you can until you try to go further.</p>
<p>Naturally I hope that growth theory can   serve in both ways: as a background on which to hang multi-sector   models that probably try to do more that can be done, and as a   framework for simple, strong, loosely quantitative propositions   about cause and effect in macroeconomics. For both roles, it   appears to me, the fundamental intellectual need is for a common   understanding of medium-run departures from equilibrium growth.   That is the stuff of everyday macroeconomics. It has been going   on in English-speaking countries since Keynes and in Sweden since   Lindahl and the Stockholm School. It is going on in both places   today.</p>

<p><b>Addendum, August 2001</b></p>
<p>My Nobel Lecture in 1987 sketched the   intellectual environment in which the neoclassical model of   economic growth was first worked out in the 1950s, and it then   discussed some of the paths along which growth theory had evolved   afterwards. I took it for granted that growth theory should be an   integral part of pragmatic macroeconomics, a model to be applied   to our own economies. My view was, and still is, that the most   urgent current analytical need was for a way of fitting together   short-run macroeconomics, when the main action consists of   variations in aggregate demand, with the long run factors   represented by the neoclassical growth model, when the main   action is on the supply side. Another way of saying this is that   short-run and long-run models of macroeconomic behavior need a   way to merge in a practical macroeconomics of the medium run.</p>
<p>Not much has been accomplished in that   direction since 1987. This may be because of the profession&#8217;s   enthusiasm for Real Business Cycle Theory, an enthusiasm I did   not share (and I explained why, briefly, in the lecture).   Nevertheless there are some recent signs of progress. A few   members of the RBC school have realized that empirical success   will not come unless at least a few realistically modelled   imperfections and frictions are absorbed into the model. But some   of these are just the imperfections and frictions &#8211; &#8220;sticky   prices&#8221; for instance &#8211; that are the true microunderpinnings of   more &#8220;Keynesian&#8221; macroeconomic models. At the same time, some   advocates of a more &#8220;Keynesian&#8221; approach have adopted some of the   favorite practices of the RBC school, for instance a more   explicit use of dynamic general equilibrium models. Creating a   seamless, unified macroeconomics of the medium run may be a   difficult or impossible task because the reality is just too   messy to be described by any small number of basic principles.   But a start has been made.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the most surprising aspect   of the 1987 lecture must be that it does not even mention the   idea of endogenous technological progress. This was primarily a   matter of timing. The first of Paul Romer&#8217;s series of papers was   published only in 1986, and Robert Lucas&#8217;s paper did not appear   in print until 1988 (although I had undoubtedly read it in   manuscript before 1987). But of course I had no way of knowing   that &#8220;endogenous growth theory&#8221; would develop into a veritable   mass movement during the 1990s. I had not forgotten my old friend   Kenneth Arrow&#8217;s 1962 paper on Learning by Doing. But I already   knew that, interesting as that model was, it made no real   difference to the basic propositions of the neoclassical growth   model. I later elaborated on this point in two Arrow Lectures   published as <i>Learning from Learning by Doing</i>.&#8221; Endogenous   growth theory as it developed was a much more drastic change.</p>
<p>We know now that endogenous growth theory   led to an avalanche of papers that has recently slowed a little,   but only a little. It is easy to see why the idea was so popular.   The models offered the possibility of having a theory of the   steady-state growth rate itself, instead of treating it as an   exogenously given, if sometimes changing, fact of life. But there   was an even more important attraction, I think. The nature of the   theory was such that one could easily find feasible, even fairly   traditional, policies that would influence the long-term growth   rate. Adding a couple of tenths of a percentage point to the   growth rate is an achievement that eventually dwarfs in welfare   significance any of the standard goals of economic policy. Who   would not be excited?</p>
<p>It is important to understand how it was   that endogenous growth theory could offer this prospect. The   earliest models simply assumed constant returns to   <i>capital</i>, or to the set of factors of production that can   be accumulated, like capital. (They were called &#8220;AK models&#8221; for   this reason.) Thus, for example, if output is just proportional   to capital and saving-and-investment is proportional to output,   then investment is proportional to capital and the   saving?investment rate enters the factor of proportionality. So a   higher saving-investment rate means a higher ratio of investment   to capital, i.e. a higher growth rate of capital, and therefore a   higher growth rate of output. But we think we know policies that   will increase the <i>level</i> of saving-investment from given   output. This easy passage from influencing a level to influencing   a growth rate is what makes the theory so powerful. The trouble   is that constant returns to capital is a highly special, pinpoint   assumption. This is one of those cases where &#8220;approximately&#8221; will   not do. But exactly constant returns to capital is not very   plausible empirically, and has no convincing theoretical   foundation either.</p>
<p>Deeper and more interesting models soon   emerged in the endogenous growth tradition. Some of them focus on   the creation and accumulation of human capital, others on the   process of technological invention and innovation (and the   temporary monopolies that go with it). There is also a   flourishing group of &#8220;Schumpeterian&#8221; models that emphasize the   rivalry (or occasional complementarity) between an innovation and   its predecessors. It seems to me that work along these lines   might eventually tell us something interesting and useful about   the role of knowledge in the economy and society. We have always   realized that there is an important endogenous element in the   development of new technology; all those businesses investing   millions in research are not suffering from a mass delusion.</p>
<p>Up to now, however, I have found that even   these deeper and more circumstantial models of endogenous growth   all rest at some key point on an essentially arbitrary linearity   assumption, on the claim that the rate of growth of this is a   function of the level of that, where &#8220;that&#8221; is some fairly simple   and accessible variable that can be maneuvered by policy. Of   course such a claim can be true, but the ones I have seen have   been neither empirically verifled nor overwhelmingly plausible   <i>a priori</i>.</p>
<p>One possible interim conclusion is that the   literature strains too singlemindedly for a theory of the   steady-state growth rate, as if exponential growth were an   intrinsic characteristic of the time-paths of industrial   economies, and not merely a convenient approximation to a segment   of such a time-path. An alternative strategy might be to begin   with unprejudiced empirical study of the determinants of the   speed of technological innovation or the accumulation of human   capital or the evolution of quality ladders for consumer goods.   These things are already studied by economists (and other social   scientists) independently of their relevance for growth theory.   Undoubtedly any valid generalizations would have to be simplified   for inclusion in an aggregative growth model, but that is only to   be expected. I suppose it is always possible that some of those   powerful linearity assumptions will prove to be valid, but I   think it unlikely. One of the advantages of cheap computation and   easy numerical integration is that the short-cut of steady state   analysis is no longer needed; one can calculate directly the path   traced out by a plausibly enhanced model of growth, and how it   responds to the standard policy moves.</p>
<p>Another, much less prominent, line of   thought may be worth mentioning. It goes back to the 1950s when   Nicholas Kaldor tried to produce a coherent growth model based   entirely on relationships among rates of growth, conspicuously   without any explicit function relating inputs and outputs. A   similar idea was taken up by Maurice Scott (<i>A New View of   Economic Growth</i>, 1989), with much more attention to arguing   the realistic case for such a relationship. (See also T. van de   Klundert&#8217;s <i>Growth Theory in Historical Perspective</i>, 2001),   especially Chapter 7.)</p>
<p>I have never been able to convince myself   that these convenient assumptions make sense, except as they are   derived from more primitive input-output relations. The examples   in the literature do not seem to have this property. My own   attempt to get at the same underlying intuition (also dating from   the 1950s) was to study &#8220;vintage models&#8221; in which technological   innovations can only be effective when they are &#8220;embodied&#8221; in new   capital goods. This attempt also languished, although it has   recently been revived in a series of papers by Greenwood,   Hercovitz, Krusell and Wolff. It seems possible that the proper   place for such models to come into their own is in the elusive   macroeconomics of the medium run.</p>
