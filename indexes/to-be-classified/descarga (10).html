<p class="smalltext">Lecture to the memory of Alfred Nobel,   December 11, 1974</p>
<p class="smalltext"> </p>
<h2>The Pretence of Knowledge</h2>
<p>The particular occasion of this lecture,   combined with the chief practical problem which economists have   to face today, have made the choice of its topic almost   inevitable. On the one hand the still recent establishment of the   Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science marks a significant step   in the process by which, in the opinion of the general public,   economics has been conceded some of the dignity and prestige of   the physical sciences. On the other hand, the economists are at   this moment called upon to say how to extricate the free world   from the serious threat of accelerating inflation which, it must   be admitted, has been brought about by policies which the   majority of economists recommended and even urged governments to   pursue. We have indeed at the moment little cause for pride: as a   profession we have made a mess of things.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this failure of the   economists to guide policy more successfully is closely connected   with their propensity to imitate as closely as possible the   procedures of the brilliantly successful physical sciences &#8211; an   attempt which in our field may lead to outright error. It is an   approach which has come to be described as the &#8220;scientistic&#8221;   attitude &#8211; an attitude which, as I defined it some thirty years   ago, &#8220;is decidedly unscientific in the true sense of the word,   since it involves a mechanical and uncritical application of   habits of thought to fields different from those in which they   have been formed.&#8221;<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a> I want today   to begin by explaining how some of the gravest errors of recent   economic policy are a direct consequence of this scientistic   error.</p>
<p>The theory which has been guiding monetary   and financial policy during the last thirty years, and which I   contend is largely the product of such a mistaken conception of   the proper scientific procedure, consists in the assertion that   there exists a simple positive correlation between total   employment and the size of the aggregate demand for goods and   services; it leads to the belief that we can permanently assure   full employment by maintaining total money expenditure at an   appropriate level. Among the various theories advanced to account   for extensive unemployment, this is probably the only one in   support of which strong quantitative evidence can be adduced. I   nevertheless regard it as fundamentally false, and to act upon   it, as we now experience, as very harmful.</p>
<p>This brings me to the crucial issue. Unlike   the position that exists in the physical sciences, in economics   and other disciplines that deal with essentially complex   phenomena, the aspects of the events to be accounted for about   which we can get quantitative data are necessarily limited and   may not include the important ones. While in the physical   sciences it is generally assumed, probably with good reason, that   any important factor which determines the observed events will   itself be directly observable and measurable, in the study of   such complex phenomena as the market, which depend on the actions   of many individuals, all the circumstances which will determine   the outcome of a process, for reasons which I shall explain   later, will hardly ever be fully known or measurable. And while   in the physical sciences the investigator will be able to measure   what, on the basis of a <i>prima facie</i> theory, he thinks   important, in the social sciences often that is treated as   important which happens to be accessible to measurement. This is   sometimes carried to the point where it is demanded that our   theories must be formulated in such terms that they refer only to   measurable magnitudes.</p>
<p>It can hardly be denied that such a demand   quite arbitrarily limits the facts which are to be admitted as   possible causes of the events which occur in the real world. This   view, which is often quite naively accepted as required by   scientific procedure, has some rather paradoxical consequences.   We know: of course, with regard to the market and similar social   structures, a great many facts which we cannot measure and on   which indeed we have only some very imprecise and general   information. And because the effects of these facts in any   particular instance cannot be confirmed by quantitative evidence,   they are simply disregarded by those sworn to admit only what   they regard as scientific evidence: they thereupon happily   proceed on the fiction that the factors which they can measure   are the only ones that are relevant.</p>
<p>The correlation between aggregate demand   and total employment, for instance, may only be approximate, but   as it is the <i>only</i> one on which we have quantitative data,   it is accepted as the only causal connection that counts. On this   standard there may thus well exist better &#8220;scientific&#8221; evidence   for a false theory, which will be accepted because it is more   &#8220;scientific&#8221;, than for a valid explanation, which is rejected   because there is no sufficient quantitative evidence for it.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate this by a brief sketch of   what I regard as the chief actual cause of extensive unemployment   &#8211; an account which will also explain why such unemployment cannot   be lastingly cured by the inflationary policies recommended by   the now fashionable theory. This correct explanation appears to   me to be the existence of discrepancies between the distribution   of demand among the different goods and services and the   allocation of labour and other resources among the production of   those outputs. We possess a fairly good &#8220;qualitative&#8221; knowledge   of the forces by which a correspondence between demand and supply   in the different sectors of the economic system is brought about,   of the conditions under which it will be achieved, and of the   factors likely to prevent such an adjustment. The separate steps   in the account of this process rely on facts of everyday   experience, and few who take the trouble to follow the argument   will question the validity of the factual assumptions, or the   logical correctness of the conclusions drawn from them. We have   indeed good reason to believe that unemployment indicates that   the structure of relative prices and wages has been distorted   (usually by monopolistic or governmental price fixing), and that   to restore equality between the demand and the supply of labour   in all sectors changes of relative prices and some transfers of   labour will be necessary.</p>
<p>But when we are asked for quantitative   evidence for the particular structure of prices and wages that   would be required in order to assure a smooth continuous sale of   the products and services offered, we must admit that we have no   such information. We know, in other words, the general conditions   in which what we call, somewhat misleadingly, an equilibrium will   establish itself: but we never know what the particular prices or   wages are which would exist if the market were to bring about   such an equilibrium. We can merely say what the conditions are in   which we can expect the market to establish prices and wages at   which demand will equal supply. But we can never produce   statistical information which would show how much the prevailing   prices and wages <i>deviate</i> from those which would secure a   continuous sale of the current supply of labour. Though this   account of the causes of unemployment is an empirical theory, in   the sense that it might be proved false, e.g. if, with a constant   money supply, a general increase of wages did not lead to   unemployment, it is certainly not the kind of theory which we   could use to obtain specific numerical predictions concerning the   rates of wages, or the distribution of labour, to be   expected.</p>
<p>Why should we, however, in economics, have   to plead ignorance of the sort of facts on which, in the case of   a physical theory, a scientist would certainly be expected to   give precise information? It is probably not surprising that   those impressed by the example of the physical sciences should   find this position very unsatisfactory and should insist on the   standards of proof which they find there. The reason for this   state of affairs is the fact, to which I have already briefly   referred, that the social sciences, like much of biology but   unlike most fields of the physical sciences, have to deal with   structures of <i>essential</i> complexity, i.e. with structures   whose characteristic properties can be exhibited only by models   made up of relatively large numbers of variables. Competition,   for instance, is a process which will produce certain results   only if it proceeds among a fairly large number of acting   persons.</p>
<p>In some fields, particularly where problems   of a similar kind arise in the physical sciences, the   difficulties can be overcome by using, instead of specific   information about the individual elements, data about the   relative frequency, or the probability, of the occurrence of the   various distinctive properties of the elements. But this is true   only where we have to deal with what has been called by Dr.   Warren Weaver (formerly of the Rockefeller Foundation), with a   distinction which ought to be much more widely understood,   &#8220;phenomena of unorganized complexity,&#8221; in contrast to those   &#8220;phenomena of organized complexity&#8221; with which we have to deal in   the social sciences.<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a> Organized   complexity here means that the character of the structures   showing it depends not only on the properties of the individual   elements of which they are composed, and the relative frequency   with which they occur, but also on the manner in which the   individual elements are connected with each other. In the   explanation of the working of such structures we can for this   reason not replace the information about the individual elements   by statistical information, but require full information about   each element if from our theory we are to derive specific   predictions about individual events. Without such specific   information about the individual elements we shall be confined to   what on another occasion I have called mere pattern predictions &#8211;   predictions of some of the general attributes of the structures   that will form themselves, but not containing specific statements   about the individual elements of which the structures will be   made up.<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>This is particularly true of our theories   accounting for the determination of the systems of relative   prices and wages that will form themselves on a wellfunctioning   market. Into the determination of these prices and wages there   will enter the effects of particular information possessed by   every one of the participants in the market process &#8211; a sum of   facts which in their totality cannot be known to the scientific   observer, or to any other single brain. It is indeed the source   of the superiority of the market order, and the reason why, when   it is not suppressed by the powers of government, it regularly   displaces other types of order, that in the resulting allocation   of resources more of the knowledge of particular facts will be   utilized which exists only dispersed among uncounted persons,   than any one person can possess. But because we, the observing   scientists, can thus never know all the determinants of such an   order, and in consequence also cannot know at which particular   structure of prices and wages demand would everywhere equal   supply, we also cannot measure the deviations from that order;   nor can we statistically test our theory that it is the   deviations from that &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; system of prices and wages   which make it impossible to sell some of the products and   services at the prices at which they are offered.</p>
<p>Before I continue with my immediate   concern, the effects of all this on the employment policies   currently pursued, allow me to define more specifically the   inherent limitations of our numerical knowledge which are so   often overlooked. I want to do this to avoid giving the   impression that I generally reject the mathematical method in   economics. I regard it in fact as the great advantage of the   mathematical technique that it allows us to describe, by means of   algebraic equations, the general character of a pattern even   where we are ignorant of the numerical values which will   determine its particular manifestation. We could scarcely have   achieved that comprehensive picture of the mutual   interdependencies of the different events in a market without   this algebraic technique. It has led to the illusion, however,   that we can use this technique for the determination and   prediction of the numerical values of those magnitudes; and this   has led to a vain search for quantitative or numerical constants.   This happened in spite of the fact that the modern founders of   mathematical economics had no such illusions. It is true that   their systems of equations describing the pattern of a market   equilibrium are so framed that if we were able to fill in all the   blanks of the abstract formulae, i.e. if we knew all the   parameters of these equations, we could calculate the prices and   quantities of all commodities and services sold. But, as Vilfredo   Pareto, one of the founders of this theory, clearly stated, its   purpose cannot be &#8220;to arrive at a numerical calculation of   prices&#8221;, because, as he said, it would be &#8220;absurd&#8221; to assume that   we could ascertain all the data.<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>   Indeed, the chief point was already seen by those remarkable   anticipators of modern economics, the Spanish schoolmen of the   sixteenth century, who emphasized that what they called   <i>pretium mathematicum</i>, the mathematical price, depended on   so many particular circumstances that it could never be known to   man but was known only to God.<a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a> I   sometimes wish that our mathematical economists would take this   to heart. I must confess that I still doubt whether their search   for measurable magnitudes has made significant contributions to   our <i>theoretical</i> understanding of economic phenomena &#8211; as   distinct from their value as a description of particular   situations. Nor am I prepared to accept the excuse that this   branch of research is still very young: Sir William Petty, the   founder of econometrics, was after all a somewhat senior   colleague of Sir Isaac Newton in the Royal Society!</p>
<p>There may be few instances in which the   superstition that only measurable magnitudes can be important has   done positive harm in the economic field: but the present   inflation and employment problems are a very serious one. Its   effect has been that what is probably the true cause of extensive   unemployment has been disregarded by the scientistically minded   majority of economists, because its operation could not be   confirmed by directly observable relations between measurable   magnitudes, and that an almost exclusive concentration on   quantitatively measurable surface phenomena has produced a policy   which has made matters worse.</p>
<p>It has, of course, to be readily admitted   that the kind of theory which I regard as the true explanation of   unemployment is a theory of somewhat limited content because it   allows us to make only very general predictions of the   <i>kind</i> of events which we must expect in a given situation.   But the effects on policy of the more ambitious constructions   have not been very fortunate and I confess that I prefer true but   imperfect knowledge, even if it leaves much indetermined and   unpredictable, to a pretence of exact knowledge that is likely to   be false. The credit which the apparent conformity with   recognized scientific standards can gain for seemingly simple but   false theories may, as the present instance shows, have grave   consequences.</p>
<p>In fact, in the case discussed, the very   measures which the dominant &#8220;macro-economic&#8221; theory has   recommended as a remedy for unemployment, namely the increase of   aggregate demand, have become a cause of a very extensive   misallocation of resources which is likely to make later   large-scale unemployment inevitable. The continuous injection of   additional amounts of money at points of the economic system   where it creates a temporary demand which must cease when the   increase of the quantity of money stops or slows down, together   with the expectation of a continuing rise of prices, draws labour   and other resources into employments which can last only so long   as the increase of the quantity of money continues at the same   rate &#8211; or perhaps even only so long as it continues to accelerate   at a given rate. What this policy has produced is not so much a   level of employment that could not have been brought about in   other ways, as a distribution of employment which cannot be   indefinitely maintained and which after some time can be   maintained only by a rate of inflation which would rapidly lead   to a disorganisation of all economic activity. The fact is that   by a mistaken theoretical view we have been led into a precarious   position in which we cannot prevent substantial unemployment from   re-appearing; not because, as this view is sometimes   misrepresented, this unemployment is deliberately brought about   as a means to combat inflation, but because it is now bound to   occur as a deeply regrettable but inescapable consequence of the   mistaken policies of the past as soon as inflation ceases to   accelerate.</p>
<p>I must, however, now leave these problems   of immediate practical importance which I have introduced chiefly   as an illustration of the momentous consequences that may follow   from errors concerning abstract problems of the philosophy of   science. There is as much reason to be apprehensive about the   long run dangers created in a much wider field by the uncritical   acceptance of assertions which have the <i>appearance</i> of   being scientific as there is with regard to the problems I have   just discussed. What I mainly wanted to bring out by the topical   illustration is that certainly in my field, but I believe also   generally in the sciences of man, what looks superficially like   the most scientific procedure is often the most unscientific,   and, beyond this, that in these fields there are definite limits   to what we can expect science to achieve. This means that to   entrust to science &#8211; or to deliberate control according to   scientific principles &#8211; more than scientific method can achieve   may have deplorable effects. The progress of the natural sciences   in modern times has of course so much exceeded all expectations   that any suggestion that there may be some limits to it is bound   to arouse suspicion. Especially all those will resist such an   insight who have hoped that our increasing power of prediction   and control, generally regarded as the characteristic result of   scientific advance, applied to the processes of society, would   soon enable us to mould society entirely to our liking. It is   indeed true that, in contrast to the exhilaration which the   discoveries of the physical sciences tend to produce, the   insights which we gain from the study of society more often have   a dampening effect on our aspirations; and it is perhaps not   surprising that the more impetuous younger members of our   profession are not always prepared to accept this. Yet the   confidence in the unlimited power of science is only too often   based on a false belief that the scientific method consists in   the application of a ready-made technique, or in imitating the   form rather than the substance of scientific procedure, as if one   needed only to follow some cooking recipes to solve all social   problems. It sometimes almost seems as if the techniques of   science were more easily learnt than the thinking that shows us   what the problems are and how to approach them.</p>
<p>The conflict between what in its present   mood the public expects science to achieve in satisfaction of   popular hopes and what is really in its power is a serious matter   because, even if the true scientists should all recognize the   limitations of what they can do in the field of human affairs, so   long as the public expects more there will always be some who   will pretend, and perhaps honestly believe, that they can do more   to meet popular demands than is really in their power. It is   often difficult enough for the expert, and certainly in many   instances impossible for the layman, to distinguish between   legitimate and illegitimate claims advanced in the name of   science. The enormous publicity recently given by the media to a   report pronouncing in the name of science on <i>The Limits to   Growth</i>, and the silence of the same media about the   devastating criticism this report has received from the competent   experts<a href="#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>, must make one feel   somewhat apprehensive about the use to which the prestige of   science can be put. But it is by no means only in the field of   economics that far-reaching claims are made on behalf of a more   scientific direction of all human activities and the desirability   of replacing spontaneous processes by &#8220;conscious human control&#8221;.   If I am not mistaken, psychology, psychiatry and some branches of   sociology, not to speak about the so-called philosophy of   history, are even more affected by what I have called the   scientistic prejudice, and by specious claims of what science can   achieve.<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>If we are to safeguard the reputation of   science, and to prevent the arrogation of knowledge based on a   superficial similarity of procedure with that of the physical   sciences, much effort will have to be directed toward debunking   such arrogations, some of which have by now become the vested   interests of established university departments. We cannot be   grateful enough to such modern philosophers of science as Sir   Karl Popper for giving us a test by which we can distinguish   between what we may accept as scientific and what not &#8211; a test   which I am sure some doctrines now widely accepted as scientific   would not pass. There are some special problems, however, in   connection with those essentially complex phenomena of which   social structures are so important an instance, which make me   wish to restate in conclusion in more general terms the reasons   why in these fields not only are there only absolute obstacles to   the prediction of specific events, but why to act as if we   possessed scientific knowledge enabling us to transcend them may   itself become a serious obstacle to the advance of the human   intellect.</p>
<p>The chief point we must remember is that   the great and rapid advance of the physical sciences took place   in fields where it proved that explanation and prediction could   be based on laws which accounted for the observed phenomena as   functions of comparatively few variables &#8211; either particular   facts or relative frequencies of events. This may even be the   ultimate reason why we single out these realms as &#8220;physical&#8221; in   contrast to those more highly organized structures which I have   here called essentially complex phenomena. There is no reason why   the position must be the same in the latter as in the former   fields. The difficulties which we encounter in the latter are   not, as one might at first suspect, difficulties about   formulating theories for the explanation of the observed events &#8211;   although they cause also special difficulties about testing   proposed explanations and therefore about eliminating bad   theories. They are due to the chief problem which arises when we   apply our theories to any particular situation in the real world.   A theory of essentially complex phenomena must refer to a large   number of particular facts; and to derive a prediction from it,   or to test it, we have to ascertain all these particular facts.   Once we succeeded in this there should be no particular   difficulty about deriving testable predictions &#8211; with the help of   modern computers it should be easy enough to insert these data   into the appropriate blanks of the theoretical formulae and to   derive a prediction. The real difficulty, to the solution of   which science has little to contribute, and which is sometimes   indeed insoluble, consists in the ascertainment of the particular   facts.</p>
<p>A simple example will show the nature of   this difficulty. Consider some ball game played by a few people   of approximately equal skill. If we knew a few particular facts   in addition to our general knowledge of the ability of the   individual players, such as their state of attention, their   perceptions and the state of their hearts, lungs, muscles etc. at   each moment of the game, we could probably predict the outcome.   Indeed, if we were familiar both with the game and the teams we   should probably have a fairly shrewd idea on what the outcome   will depend. But we shall of course not be able to ascertain   those facts and in consequence the result of the game will be   outside the range of the scientifically predictable, however well   we may know what effects particular events would have on the   result of the game. This does not mean that we can make no   predictions at all about the course of such a game. If we know   the rules of the different games we shall, in watching one, very   soon know which game is being played and what kinds of actions we   can expect and what kind not. But our capacity to predict will be   confined to such general characteristics of the events to be   expected and not include the capacity of predicting particular   individual events.</p>
<p>This corresponds to what I have called   earlier the mere pattern predictions to which we are increasingly   confined as we penetrate from the realm in which relatively   simple laws prevail into the range of phenomena where organized   complexity rules. As we advance we find more and more frequently   that we can in fact ascertain only some but not all the   particular circumstances which determine the outcome of a given   process; and in consequence we are able to predict only some but   not all the properties of the result we have to expect. Often all   that we shall be able to predict will be some abstract   characteristic of the pattern that will appear &#8211; relations   between kinds of elements about which individually we know very   little. Yet, as I am anxious to repeat, we will still achieve   predictions which can be falsified and which therefore are of   empirical significance.</p>
<p>Of course, compared with the precise   predictions we have learnt to expect in the physical sciences,   this sort of mere pattern predictions is a second best with which   one does not like to have to be content. Yet the danger of which   I want to warn is precisely the belief that in order to have a   claim to be accepted as scientific it is necessary to achieve   more. This way lies charlatanism and worse. To act on the belief   that we possess the knowledge and the power which enable us to   shape the processes of society entirely to our liking, knowledge   which in fact we do <i>not</i> possess, is likely to make us do   much harm. In the physical sciences there may be little objection   to trying to do the impossible; one might even feel that one   ought not to discourage the over-confident because their   experiments may after all produce some new insights. But in the   social field the erroneous belief that the exercise of some power   would have beneficial consequences is likely to lead to a new   power to coerce other men being conferred on some authority. Even   if such power is not in itself bad, its exercise is likely to   impede the functioning of those spontaneous ordering forces by   which, without understanding them, man is in fact so largely   assisted in the pursuit of his aims. We are only beginning to   understand on how subtle a communication system the functioning   of an advanced industrial society is based &#8211; a communications   system which we call the market and which turns out to be a more   efficient mechanism for digesting dispersed information than any   that man has deliberately designed.</p>
<p>If man is not to do more harm than good in   his efforts to improve the social order, he will have to learn   that in this, as in all other fields where essential complexity   of an organized kind prevails, he cannot acquire the full   knowledge which would make mastery of the events possible. He   will therefore have to use what knowledge he can achieve, not to   shape the results as the craftsman shapes his handiwork, but   rather to cultivate a growth by providing the appropriate   environment, in the manner in which the gardener does this for   his plants. There is danger in the exuberant feeling of ever   growing power which the advance of the physical sciences has   engendered and which tempts man to try, &#8220;dizzy with success&#8221;, to   use a characteristic phrase of early communism, to subject not   only our natural but also our human environment to the control of   a human will. The recognition of the insuperable limits to his   knowledge ought indeed to teach the student of society a lesson   of humility which should guard him against becoming an accomplice   in men&#8217;s fatal striving to control society &#8211; a striving which   makes him not only a tyrant over his fellows, but which may well   make him the destroyer of a civilization which no brain has   designed but which has grown from the free efforts of millions of   individuals.</p>
