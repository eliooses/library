<h2>Modern Economic Growth: Findings and Reflections</h2>
<p><b>1. Definitions</b><br />   A country&#8217;s economic growth may be defined as a long-term rise in   capacity to supply increasingly diverse economic goods to its   population, this growing capacity based on advancing technology   and the institutional and ideological adjustments that it   demands. All three components of the definition are important.   The sustained rise in the supply of goods is the <i>result</i> of   economic growth, by which it is identified. Some small countries   can provide increasing income to their populations because they   happen to possess a resource (minerals, location, etc.)   exploitable by more developed nations, that yields a large and   increasing rent. Despite intriguing analytical problems that   these few fortunate countries raise, we are interested here only   in the nations that derive abundance by using advanced   contemporary technology &#8211; not by selling fortuitous gifts of   nature to others. Advancing technology is the <i>permissive</i>   source of economic growth, but it is only a potential, a   necessary condition, in itself not sufficient. If technology is   to be employed efficiently and widely, and, indeed, if its own   progress is to be stimulated by such use, institutional and   ideological adjustments must be made to effect the proper use of   innovations generated by the advancing stock of human knowledge.   To cite examples from modern economic growth: steam and electric   power and the large-scale plants needed to exploit them are not   compatible with family enterprise, illiteracy, or slavery &#8211; all   of which prevailed in earlier times over much of even the   developed world, and had to be replaced by more appropriate   institutions and social views. Nor is modern technology   compatible with the rural mode of life, the large and extended   family pattern, and veneration of undisturbed nature.</p>
<p>The source of technological progress, the   particular production sectors that it affected most, and the pace   at which it and economic growth advanced, differed over centuries   and among regions of the world; and so did the institutional and   ideological adjustments in their interplay with the technological   changes introduced into and diffused through the growing   economies. The major breakthroughs in the advance of human   knowledge, those that constituted dominant sources of sustained   growth over long periods and spread to a substantial part of the   world, may be termed epochal innovations. And the changing course   of economic history can perhaps be subdivided into economic   epochs, each identified by the epochal innovation with the   distinctive characteristics of growth that it generated.<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a> Without considering the feasibility of   identifying and dating such economic epochs, we may proceed on   the working assumption that modern economic growth represents   such a distinct epoch &#8211; growth dating back to the late eighteenth   century and limited (except in significant <i>partial</i>   effects) to economically developed countries. These countries, so   classified because they have managed to take adequate advantage   of the potential of modern technology, include most of Europe,   the overseas offshoots of Western Europe, and Japan &#8211; barely one   quarter of world population.<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a> This   paper will focus on modern economic growth, but with obviously   needed attention to its worldwide impact.</p>
<p>Limitations of space prevent the   presentation of a documented summary of the quantitative   characteristics commonly observed in the growth of the presently   developed countries, characteristics different from those of   economic growth in earlier epochs. However, some of them are   listed, because they contribute to our understanding of the   distinctive problems of economic life in the world today. While   the list is selective and is open to charges of omission, it   includes those observed and empirically testable characteristics   that lead back to some basic factors and conditions, which can   only be glimpsed and conjectured, and forward to some   implications that have so far eluded measurement.</p>
<p><b>2. The six characteristics</b><br />   Six characteristics of modern economic growth have emerged in the   analysis based on conventional measures of national product and   its components, population, labor force, and the like. First and   most obvious are the high rates of growth of per capita product   and of population in the developed countries &#8211; both large   multiples of the previous rates observable in these countries and   of those in the rest of the world, at least until the recent   decade or two.<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a> Second, the rate   of rise in productivity, i.e. of output per unit of all inputs,   is high, even when we include among inputs other factors in   addition to labor, the major productive factor &#8211; and here too the   rate is a large multiple of the rate in the past.<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a> Third, the rate of structural   transformation of the economy is high. Major aspects of   structural change include the shift away from agriculture to   non-agricultural pursuits and, recently, away from industry to   services; a change in the scale of productive units, and a   related shift from personal enterprise to impersonal organization   of economic firms, with a corresponding change in the   occupational status of labor.<a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a>   Shifts in several others aspects of economic structure could be   added (in the structure of consumption, in the relative shares of   domestic and foreign supplies, etc.). Fourth, the closely related   and extremely important structures of society and its ideology   have also changed rapidly. Urbanization and secularization come   easily to mind as components of what sociologists term the   process of modernization. Fifth, the economically developed   countries, by means of the increased power of technology,   particularly in transport and communication (both peaceful and   warlike), have the propensity to reach out to the rest of the   world &#8211; thus making for one world in the sense in which this was   not true in any pre-modern epoch.<a href="#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>   Sixth, the spread of modern economic growth, despite its   worldwide partial effects, is limited in that the economic   performance in countries accounting for three-quarters of world   population still falls far short of the minimum levels feasible   with the potential of modern technology.<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>This brief summary of two quantitative   characteristics of modern economic growth that relate to   aggregate rates, two that relate to structural transformation,   and two that relate to international spread, supports our working   assumption that modern economic growth marks a distinct economic   epoch. If the rates of aggregate growth and the speed of   structural transformation in the economic, institutional, and   perhaps even in the ideological, framework are SO much higher   than in the past as to represent a revolutionary acceleration,   and if the various regions of the world are for the first time in   history so closely interrelated as to be one, some new major   growth source, some new epochal innovation, must have generated   these radically different patterns. And one may argue that this   source is the emergence of modern science as the basis of   advancing technology &#8211; a breakthrough in the evolution of science   that produced a potential for technology far greater than existed   previously.</p>
<p>Yet modern growth continues many older   trends, if in greatly accelerated form. This continuity is   important particularly when we find that, except for Japan and   possibly Russia, all presently developed countries were well in   advance of the rest of the world before their modern growth and   industrialization began, enjoying a comparative advantage   produced by pre-modern trends. It is also important because it   emphasizes that distinction among economic epochs is a   complicated intellectual choice and that the continuation of past   trends and their changing patterns over time are subjects   deserving the closest attention. Does the acceleration in growth   of product and productivity in many developed countries in the   last two decades reflect a major change in the potential provided   by science-oriented technology, or a major change in the capacity   of societies to catch up with that potential? Is it a way of   recouping the loss in standing, relative to such a leader as the   United States, that was incurred during the depression of the   thirties and World War II? Or, finally, is it merely a reflection   of the temporarily favourable climate of the U.S. international   policies? Is the expansion into space a continuation of the old   trend of reaching out by the developed countries, or is it a   precursor of a new economic epoch? These questions are clearly   illustrative, but they hint at broader analytical problems   suggested by the observation of modern economic growth as a   distinct epoch.</p>
<p>The six characteristics noted are   interrelated, and the interrelations among them are most   significant. With the rather stable ratio of labor force to total   population, a high rate of increase in per capita product means a   high rate of increase in product per worker; and, with average   hours of work declining, it means still higher growth rates in   product per manhour. Even if we allow for the impressive   accumulation of capital, in its widest sense, the growth rate of   productivity is high, and, indeed, mirrors the great rise in per   capita product and in per capita pure consumption. Since the   latter reflects the realized effects of advancing technology,   rapid changes in production structure are inevitable &#8211; given the   differential impact of technological innovations on the several   production sectors, the differing income elasticity of domestic   demand for various consumer goods, and the changing comparative   advantage in foreign trade. As already indicated, advancing   technology changes the scale of production plants and the   character of the economic enterprise units. Consequently,   effective participation in the modern economic system by the   labor force necessitates rapid changes in its location and   structure, in the relations among occupational status groups, and   even in the relations between labor force and total population   (the last, however, within narrow overall limits). Thus, not only   are high aggregate growth rates associated with rapid changes in   economic structure, but the latter are also associated with rapid   changes in other aspects of society &#8211; in family formation, in   urbanization, in man&#8217;s views on his role and the measure of his   achievement in society. The dynamic drives of modern economic   growth, in the countries that entered the process ahead of   others, meant a reaching out geographically; and the sequential   spread of the process, facilitated by major changes in transport   and communication, meant a continuous expansion to the less   developed areas. At the same time, the difficulty of making the   institutional and ideological transformations needed to convert   the new large potential of modern technology into economic growth   in the relatively short period since the late eighteenth century   limited the spread of the system. Moreover, obstacles to such   transformation were, and still are being, imposed on the less   developed regions by the policies of the developed countries.</p>
<p>If the characteristics of modern economic   growth are interrelated, in that one induces another in a cause   and effect sequence or all are concurrent effects of a common set   of underlying factors, another plausible and significant link   should be noted. Mass application of technological innovations,   which constitutes much of the distinctive substance of modern   economic growth, is closely connected with the further progress   of science, in its turn the basis for additional advance in   technology. While this topic is still to be studied in depth, it   seems fairly clear that mass-uses of technical innovations (many   based on recent scientific discoveries) provide a positive   feedback. Not only do they provide a larger economic surplus for   basic and applied research with long time leads and heavy capital   demands, but, more specifically, they permit the development of   new efficient tools for scientific use and supply new data on the   behavior of natural processes under the stress of modification in   economic production. In other words, many production plants in   developed countries can be viewed as laboratories for the   exploration of natural processes and as centers of research on   new tools, both of which are of immense service to basic and   applied research in science and technology. It is no accident   that the last two centuries were also periods of enormous   acceleration in the contribution to the stock of useful knowledge   by basic and applied research &#8211; which provided additional stimuli   to new technological innovations. Thus, modern economic growth   reflects an interrelation that sustains the high rate of advance   through the feedback from mass applications to further knowledge.   And unless some obstacles intervene, it provides a mechanism for   self-sustaining technological advance, to which, given the wide   expanse of the universe (relative to mankind on this planet),   there are no obvious proximate limits.</p>
<p><b>3. Some implications<a href="#not8"><sup>8</sup></a></b><br />   I turn now to a brief discussion of some social implications, of   some effects of modern economic growth on conditions of life of   various population groups in the countries affected. Many of   these effects are of particular interest, because they are not   reflected in the current measures of economic growth; and the   increasing realization of this shortcoming of the measures has   stimulated lively discussion of the limits and limitations of   economic measurement of economic growth.</p>
<p>The effects on conditions of life stem   partly from the major role of technological innovations in modern   economic growth, and partly from the rapid shifts in the   underlying production structure. To begin with the latter, the   major effects of which, e.g. urbanization, internal migration,   shift to employee status and what might be called the merit basis   of job choice, have already been noted as characteristics of   modern economic growth. Two important groups of effects of this   rapid transformation of economic structure deserve explicit   reference.</p>
<p>First, the changes in conditions of life   suggested by &#8220;urbanization&#8221; clearly involved a variety of costs   and returns that are not now included in economic measurement,   and some of which may never be susceptible to measurement.   Internal migration, from the countryside to the cities (within a   country, and often international) represented substantial costs   in the pulling up of roots and the adjustment to the anonymity   and higher costs of urban living. The learning of new skills and   the declining value of previously acquired skills was clearly a   costly process &#8211; to both the individuals and to society. But if   such costs were omitted from measurement, as they still are in   conventional accounts, so were some returns. Urban life, with its   denser population, provided amenities and spiritual goods that   were not available in the &#8220;dull and brutish&#8221; life of the   countryside; and the new skills, once learned, were often a more   adequate basis for a richer life than the old. This comment on   the hidden costs and returns involved in the shift toward urban   life may apply to many other costs and returns involved in other   shifts imposed by economic growth, e.g. in the character of   participation in economic activity, in the social values, and in   the new pressures on deviant members of society.</p>
<p>The second intriguing aspect of structural   change is that it represents shifts in the relative shares in the   economy of the specific population groups attached to particular   production sectors. Since economic engagement represents a   dominant influence in the life of people, the shift in the share   of a specific sector, with its distinctive characteristics and   even mode of life, affects the population group engaged in it.   Economic growth perforce brings about a decline in the relative   position of one group after another &#8211; of farmers, of small scale   producers, of landowners &#8211; a change not easily accepted, and, in   fact, as history teaches us, often resisted. The continuous   disturbance of pre-existing <i>relative</i> position of the   several economic groups is pregnant with conflict &#8211; despite the   rises in absolute income or product common to all groups. In some   cases, these conflicts did break out into overt civil war, the   Civil War in the United States being a conspicuous example. Other   examples, in the early periods of industrialization among the   currently developed countries, or, for that matter, more recently   within some less developed countries, are not lacking.</p>
<p>Only if such conflicts are resolved without   excessive costs, and certainly without a long-term weakening of   the political fabric of the society, is modern economic growth   possible. The sovereign state, with authority based on loyalty   and on a community of feeling &#8211; in short, the modern national   state &#8211; plays a crucial role in peacefully resolving such   growth-induced conflicts. But this and other services of the   national state may be costly in various ways, of which   intensified nationalism is one and other effects are too familiar   to mention. The records of many developed countries reveal   examples of resolutions of growth conflicts, of payments for   overcoming resistance and obstacles to growth, that left   burdensome heritages for the following generations (notably in   Germany and Japan). Of course, this is not the only economic   function of the state: it can also stimulate growth and   structural change. And, to mention a closely related service, it   can refer, select, or discard, legal and institutional   innovations that are proposed in the attempt to organize and   channel effectively the new production potentialities. This, too,   is a matter that may generate conflicts, since different legal   and institutional arrangements may have different effects on the   several economic groups in society.</p>
<p>In that modern economic growth has to   contend with the resolution of incipient conflicts continuously   generated by rapid changes in economic and social structure, it   may be described as a process of controlled revolution. The   succession of technological innovations characteristic of modern   economic growth and the social innovations that provide the   needed adjustments are major factors affecting economic and   social structure. But these innovations have other effects that   deserve explicit mention; and while these are discussed below in   terms of effects of technological innovations, the conclusions   apply <i>pari passu</i> to innovations in legal forms, in   institutional structure, and even in ideology.</p>
<p>A technological innovation, particularly   one based on a recent major invention, represents a venture into   the partly unknown, something not fully known until the mass   spread of the innovation reveals the full range of direct and   related effects. An invention is a major one if it provides the   basis for extensive applications and improvements (e.g. the   stationary steam engine in the form attributable mostly to James   Watt). Its cumulative effects, all new, extend over a long period   and result in an enormous transformation of economic production   and of production relations. But these new effects can hardly be   fully anticipated or properly evaluated in advance (and sometimes   not even post facto). This is true also of electric power, the   internal combustion engine, atomic energy, the application of   short rays to communication and computation, the inventions   resulting in such new industrial materials as steel, aluminum,   and plastics, and so on through a long list that marked modern   economic growth. Even when the technological innovation is an   adaptation of a known technique by a follower country, the   results may not be fully foreseeable, for they represent the   combination of something known, the technology, with something   new, an institutional and ideological framework with which it has   not previously been combined. Needless to say, the element of the   uniquely new, of exploration into the unknown, was also prominent   in pre-modern times, since innovations in knowledge and   technology are the pre-requisites for any significant growth. But   the <i>rate</i> of succession of such innovations was clearly   more rapid in modern economic growth, and provided the base for a   higher rate of aggregate growth.</p>
<p>The effects of such ventures into the new   and partly unknown are numerous. Those of most interest here are   the <i>surprises</i>, the unexpected results, which may be   positive or negative. An invention or innovation may prove far   more productive, and induce a far wider mass application and many   more cumulative improvements than were dreamed of by the inventor   and the pioneer group of entrepreneurs. Or the mass application   of a major invention may produce unexpected dis-economies of a   scale that could hardly be foreseen in the early phases of its   diffusion. Examples of both positive and negative surprises   abound. Many Schumpeterian entrepreneurs failed to grasp, by a   wide margin, the full scope and significance of the innovations   that they were promoting and that eventually brought them fame   and fortune. And most of us can point at the unexpected negative   effects of some technological or social invention that first   appeared to be an unlimited blessing.</p>
<p>The significant aspect here is that the   surprises cannot be viewed as accidents: they are inherent in the   process of technological (and social) innovation in that it   contains an element of the unknown. Furthermore, the diffusion of   a major innovation is a long and complicated sequence that cannot   be accurately forecast, with an initial economic effect that may   generate responses in other processes. These will, in turn,   change the conditions under which the innovation exercises its   effect on human welfare, and raise further problems of   adjustment. To illustrate: we can today follow easily the   sequence from the introduction of the passenger car as a mass   means of transportation, to the growth of the suburbs, to the   movement of the more affluent from the city centers, to the   concentration of lower income recipients and unemployed   immigrants in the slums of the inner city core, to the acute   urban problems, financial and other, and to the trend toward   metropolitan consolidation. But the nature and implications of   this sequence were certainly not apparent in the 1920&#8217;s, when   passenger cars began their mass service function in the United   States.</p>
<p>Indeed, to push this speculative line   further, one can argue that all economic growth brings   <i>some</i> unexpected results in its wake, positive as well as   negative, with the latter taking on greater importance as the   mass effects of major innovations are felt and the needs that   they are meant to satisfy are met. If the argument is valid,   modern economic growth, with the rapid succession of innovations   and shortening period of their mass diffusion, must be   accompanied by a relatively high incidence of negative effects.   Yet one must not forget that pre-modern economic growth had   similar problems, which, with the weaker technology, may have   loomed even larger. Even if we disregard the threatening   exhaustion of natural resources, a problem that so concerned   Classical (and implicitly even Marxian) economics, and consider   only early urbanization, one major negative effect was the   significant rise in death rates as population moved from the more   salubrious countryside to the infection-prone denser conditions   of unsanitary cities. Two points are relevant here. First, the   negative effects of growth have never been viewed as so far   outweighing its positive contribution as to lead to its   renunciation &#8211; no matter how crude the underlying calculus may   have been. Second, one may assume that once an unexpected   negative result of growth emerges, the potential of material and   social technology is aimed at its reduction or removal. In many   cases these negative results were allowed to accumulate and to   become serious technological or social problems because it was so   difficult to foresee them early enough in the process to take   effective preventive or ameliorative action. Even when such   action was initiated, there may have been delay in the effective   technological or policy solution. Still, one may justifiably   argue, in the light of the history of economic growth, in which a   succession of such unexpected negative results has been overcome,   that any specific problem so generated will be temporary &#8211;   although we shall never be free of them, no matter what economic   development is attained.</p>
<p><b>4. The Less Developed   Countries</b><br />   Two major groups of factors appear to have limited the spread of   modern economic growth. First, as already suggested, such growth   demands a stable, but flexible, political and social framework,   capable of accommodating rapid structural change and resolving   the conflicts that it generates, while encouraging the   growth-promoting groups in society. Such a framework is not   easily or rapidly attained, as evidenced by the long struggles   toward it even in some of the presently developed countries in   the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Japan is the only   nation outside of those rooted in European civilization that has   joined the group of developed countries so far. Emergence of a   modern framework for economic growth may be especially difficult   if it involves elements peculiar to European civilization for   which substitutes are not easily found. Second, the increasingly   national cast of organization in developed countries made for   policies toward other parts of the world that, while introducing   some modern economic and social elements, were, in many areas,   clearly inhibiting. These policies ranged from the imposition of   colonial status to other limitations on political freedom, and,   as a result, political independence and removal of the inferior   status of the native members of the community, rather than   economic advance, were given top priority.</p>
<p>Whatever the weight of the several factors   in explaining the failure of the less developed countries to take   advantage of the potential of modern economic growth, a topic   that, in its range from imperialist exploitation to backwardness   of the native economic and social framework, lends itself to   passionate and biased polemic, the factual findings are clear. At   present, about two-thirds or more of world population is in the   economically less developed group. Even more significant is the   concentration of the population at the low end of the product per   capita range. In 1965, the last year for which we have worldwide   comparable product estimates, the per capita GDP (at market   prices) of 1.72 billion out of a world total of 3.27 billion, was   less than $120, whereas 0.86 billion in economically developed   countries had a per capita product of some $1900. Even with this   narrow definition of less developed countries, the intermediate   group was less than 0.7 billion, or less than 20 percent of world   population.<a href="#not9"><sup>9</sup></a> The preponderant   population was thus divided between the very low and the rather   high level of per capita economic performance. Obviously, this   aspect of modern economic growth deserves our greatest attention,   and the fact that the quantitative data and our knowledge of the   institutional structures of the less developed countries are, at   the moment, far more limited than our knowledge of the developed   areas, is not reason enough for us to ignore it.</p>
<p>Several preliminary findings, or rather   plausible impressions, may be noted. First, the group of less   developed countries, particularly if we widen it (as we should)   to include those with a per capita product somewhat larger than   $120 (in 1965 prices), covers an extremely wide range in size, in   the relation between population and natural resources, in major   inherited institutions, and in the past impact upon them of the   developed countries (coming as it did at different times and from   different sources). There is a striking contrast, e.g., in terms   of population size, between the giants like Mainland China and   India, on the one hand, and the scores of tiny states in Africa   and Latin America; as there is between the timing of direct   Western impact on Africa and of that on many countries in Latin   America. Furthermore, the remarkable institutions by which the   Sinic and East Indian civilizations produced the unified, huge   societies that dwarfed in size any that originated in Europe   until recently, bore little resemblance to those that structured   the American Indian societies or those that fashioned the   numerous tribal societies of Africa.</p>
<p>Generalizations about less developed   countries must be carefully and critically scrutinized in the   light of this wide variety of conditions and institutions. To be   sure, their common failure to exploit the potential of modern   economic growth means several specific common features: a low per   capita product, a large share of agriculture or other extractive   industries, a generally small scale of production. But the   specific parameters differ widely, and because the obstacles to   growth may differ critically in their substance, they may suggest   different policy directions.</p>
<p>Second, the growth position of the less   developed countries today is significantly different, in many   respects, from that of the presently developed countries on the   eve of their entry into modern economic growth (with the possible   exception of Japan, and one cannot be sure even of that). The   less developed areas that account for the largest part of the   world population today are at much lower per capita product   levels than were the developed countries just before their   industrialization; and the latter at that time were economically   in advance of the rest of the world, not at the low end of the   per capita product range. The very magnitudes, as well as some of   the basic conditions, are quite different: no country that   entered modern economic growth (except Russia) approached the   size of India or China, or even of Pakistan and Indonesia; and no   currently developed country had to adjust to the very high rates   of natural increase of population that have characterized many   less developed countries over the last two or three decades.   Particularly before World War I, the older European countries,   and to some extent even Japan, relieved some strains of   industrialization by substantial emigration of the displaced   population to areas with more favorable opportunities &#8211; an avenue   closed to the populous less developed countries today. Of course,   the stock of material and social technology that can be tapped by   less developed countries today is enormously larger than that   available in the nineteenth and even early twentieth centuries.   But it is precisely this combination of greater backwardness and   seemingly greater backlog of technology that makes for the   significant differences between the growth position of the less   developed countries today and that of the developed countries   when they were entering the modern economic growth process.</p>
<p>Finally, it may well be that, despite the   tremendous accumulation of material and social technology, the   stock of innovations most suitable to the needs of the less   developed countries is not too abundant. Even if one were to   argue that progress in basic science may not be closely tied to   the technological needs of the country of origin (and even that   may be disputed), unquestionably the applied advances, the   inventions and tools, are a response to the specific needs of the   country within which they originate. This was certainly true of   several major inventions associated with the Industrial   Revolution in England, and illustrations abound of necessity as   the mother of invention. To the extent that this is true, and   that the conditions of production in the developed countries   differed greatly from those in the populous less developed   countries today, the material technology evolved in the developed   countries may not supply the needed innovations. Nor is the   social technology that evolved in the developed countries likely   to provide models of institutions or arrangements suitable to the   diverse institutional and population-size backgrounds of many   less developed countries. Thus, modern technology with its   emphasis on labor-saving inventions may not be suited to   countries with a plethora of labor but a scarcity of other   factors, such as land and water; and modern institutions, with   their emphasis on personal responsibility and pursuit of economic   interest, may not be suited to the more traditional life patterns   of the agricultural communities that predominate in many less   developed countries. These comments should not be interpreted as   denying the value of many transferable parts of modern   technology; they are merely intended to stress the possible   shortage of material and social tools specifically fitted to the   different needs of the less developed countries.</p>
<p>If the observations just made are valid,   several implications for the growth problems of the less   developed countries follow. I hesitate to formulate them   explicitly, since the data and the stock of knowledge on which   the observations rest are limited. But at least one implication   is sufficiently intriguing, and seems to be illuminating of many   recent events in the field, to warrant a brief note. It is that a   substantial economic advance in the less developed countries may   require modifications in the available stock of material   technology, and probably even greater innovations in political   and social structure. It will not be a matter of merely borrowing   existing tools, material and social; or of directly applying past   patterns of growth, merely allowing for the difference in   parameters.</p>
<p>The innovational requirements are likely to   be particularly great in the social and political structures. The   rather violent changes in these structures that occurred in those   countries that have forged ahead with highly forced   industrialization under Communist auspices, the pioneer entry   going back over forty years (beginning with the first Five-year   Plan in the U.S.S.R.), are conspicuous illustrations of the kind   of social invention and innovation that may be involved. And the   variants even of Communist organization, let alone those of   democracy and of non-Communist authoritarianism, are familiar. It   would be an oversimplification to argue that these innovations in   the social and political structures were made primarily in   response to the strain between economic backwardness and the   potential of modern economic growth; or to claim that they were   inexorable effects of antecedent history. But to whatever the   struggle for political and social organization is a response,   once it has been resolved, the results shape significantly the   conditions under which economic growth can occur. It seems highly   probable that a long period of experimentation and struggle   toward a viable political framework compatible with adequate   economic growth lies ahead for most less developed countries of   today; and this process will become more intensive and acute as   the <i>perceived</i> gap widens between what has been attained   and what is attainable with modern economic growth. While an   economist can argue that some aspects of growth must be present   because they are indispensable components (i.e.   industrialization, large scale of production, etc.), even their   parameters are bound to be variable; and many specific   characteristics will be so dependent upon the outcome of the   social and political innovations that extrapolation from the past   is extremely hazardous.</p>
<p><b>5. Concluding Comments</b><br />   The aim of the discussion was to sketch the major characteristics   of modern economic growth, and to note some of the implications   that the empirical study of economic growth of nations suggests.   This study goes back to the beginning of our discipline, as   indicated by the title of Adam Smith&#8217;s founding treatise,   <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, which could as well have been called   the Economic Growth of Nations. But the quantitative base and   interest in economic growth have widened greatly in the last   three to four decades, and the accumulated results of past study   of economic history and of past economic analysis could be   combined with the richer stock of quantitative data to advance   the empirical study of the process. The sketch above draws upon   the results of many and widely varied studies in many countries,   most of them economically developed; and the discussion reflects   a wide collective effort, however individual some of my   interpretations may be.</p>
<p>The most distinctive feature of modern   economic growth is the combination of a high rate of aggregate   growth with disrupting effects and new &#8220;problems&#8221;. The high rate   of growth is sustained by the interplay between mass applications   of technological innovations based on additions to the stock of   knowledge and further additions to that stock. The disrupting   effects are those imposed by the rapid rate of change in economic   and social structure. The problems are the unexpected and   unforeseeable results of the spread of innovations (with emphasis   on the new and unknown indicated by that term). Added to this is   the range of problems raised by the slow spread of economic   growth to the less developed countries, all of which have a long   history, separate and relatively isolated from the areas within   which modern economic growth originated. Thus, concurrent with   the remarkable positive achievements of modern economic growth   are unexpected negative results even within the developed   countries; while the less developed countries are struggling in   the attempt to use the large potential of modern technology in   order to assume an adequate role in the one and interdependent   world (from which they cannot withdraw even if they wished to do   so).</p>
<p>We have stressed the problem aspects of   modern economic growth because they indicate the directions of   further research in the field. These aspects, the &#8220;surprises&#8221; and   the implicit explanatory &#8220;puzzles&#8221;, are problems not only in the   sense of departures from the desirable (that may call for policy   amelioration) but also in the sense that our quantitative data   and particularly our analytical hypotheses do not provide us with   a full view and explanation. As already noted, the conventional   measures of national product and its components do not reflect   many costs of adjustment in the economic and social structures to   the channeling of major technological innovations; and, indeed,   also omit some positive returns. The earlier theory that   underlies these measures defined the productive factors in a   relatively narrow way, and left the rise in productivity as an   unexplained gap, as a measure of our ignorance. This shortcoming   of the theory in confrontation with the new findings, has led to   a lively discussion in the field in recent years, and to attempts   to expand the national accounting framework to encompass the so   far hidden but clearly important costs, for example, in education   as capital investment, in the shift to urban life, or in the   pollution and other negative results of mass production. These   efforts will also uncover some so far unmeasured positive returns   &#8211; in the way of greater health and longevity, greater mobility,   more leisure, less income inequality, and the like. The related   efforts to include the additions to knowledge in the framework of   economic analysis, the greater attention to the uses of time and   to the household as the focus of economic decision not only on   consumtion but also on investment, are steps in the same   direction. It seems fairly clear that a number of analytical and   measurement problems remain in the theory and in the evaluation   of economic growth in the developed countries themselves; and   that one may look forward to major changes in some aspects of the   analysis, in national economic accounting, and in the stock of   empirical findings, which will occupy economists in the developed   countries in the years ahead.</p>
<p>For the less developed countries the tasks   of economic research are somewhat different: the great need is   for a wider supply of tested data, which means essentially data   that have been scrutinized in the process of use for economic   analysis. As already noted, the stock of data and of economic   analysis is far poorer for these countries than that for the   developed countries &#8211; a parallel to the smaller relative supply   of material capital. Yet in recent years there has been rapid   accumulation of data for many less developed areas, other than   those that, like Mainland China, view data as information useful   to their enemies (external or internal) and are therefore either   not revealed by government or possibly not even collected. The   lag has been in the analysis of these data by economists and   other social science scholars, because of the scarcity of such   scholars who cannot be spared for research within the less   developed countries themselves and because of the natural   preoccupation of economists in the developed countries with the   problems of their own countries. One may hope, but with limited   expectations, that the task of refining analysis and measurement   in the developed countries will not be pursued to the exclusion   or neglect of badly needed studies of the less developed   countries, studies that would deal with the quantitative bases   and institutional conditions of their performance, in addition to   those concentrating on what appear to be their major bottlenecks   and the seemingly optimal policy prescriptions.</p>

<p class="smalltext"><a name="#not3" href="/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1971/"></a>3. For the non-Communist   developed countries, the rates of growth per year over the period   of modern economic growth, were almost 2 percent for product per   capita, 1 percent for population, and 3 percent for total   product. These rates &#8211; which mean roughly a multiplication over a   century by five for product per capita, by three for population,   and by more than fifteen for total product &#8211; were far greater   than pre-modern rates. The latter can only be conjectured, but   reasonable estimates for Western Europe over the long period from   the early Middle Ages to the mid-nineteenth century suggest that   the modern rate of growth is about ten times as high for product   per capita (see Simon Kuznets, <i>Economic Growth of Nations:   Total Output and Production Structure</i>, Harvard University   Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1971, pp. 10-27). A similar comparison   for population, either for Europe or for the area of European   settlement (i.e. Europe, the Americas, and Oceania), relating to   1850-1960, as compared with 1000-1850, suggests a. multiple of 4   or 5 to 1 (see Simon Kuznets, <i>Modern Economic Growth: Rate,   Structure, and Spread</i>, Yale University Press, New Haven,   Corm., 1966, Tables 2.1 and 2.2, pp. 35 and 38). The implied   acceleration in the growth rate of total product is between forty   and fifty times.</p>

Using the   conventional national economic accounts, we find that the rate of   increase in productivity is large enough to account (in the   statistical sense) for almost the entire growth of product per   capita. Even with adjustments to allow for hidden costs and   inputs, growth in productivity accounts for over half of the   growth in product per capita (see Simon Kuznets, <i>Economic   Growth of Nations: Total Output and Production Structure</i>,   Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1971, pp. 51-75,   particularly Table 9, p. 74; and Table 11, p. 93).</p>
<p class="smalltext"><a name="not5" id="not5" href="/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1971/"></a>5. The rapidity   of structural shifts in modern times can be easily illustrated by   the changes in the distribution of the labor force between   agriculture (and related industries) and the non-agricultural   production sectors. In the United States, the share of labor   force attached to the agricultural sector was still 53.5 percent   in 1870 and declined to less than 7 percent in 1960. In an old   European country like Belgium, the share of agriculture in the   labor force, 51 percent in 1846, dropped to 12.5 percent in 1947   and further to 7.5 percent in 1961 (see P. Bairoch and others,   <i>The Working Population and Its Structure, International   Historical Statistics</i>, vol. I, Institut de Sociologic,   Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels 1968, Tables D-4 and   C-4). Considering that it took centuries for the share of the   agricultural sector in the labor force to decline to 50 percent   in any sizable country (i.e. excluding small &#8220;city enclaves&#8221;), a   drop of 30 to 40 percentage points in the course of a single   century is a strikingly fast structural change.</p>
<p class="smalltext"><a name="not6" id="not6" href="/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1971/"></a>6. The outward   expansion of developed countries, with their European origin,   goes back to long before modern economic growth, indeed, back to   the Crusades. But the much augmented transportation and   communication power of developed countries in the nineteenth   century permitted a much greater and more direct political   dominance over the colonies, the &#8220;opening up&#8221; of previously   closed areas (such as Japan), and the &#8220;partition&#8221; of previously   undivided areas (such as sub-Saharan Africa).</p>
<p class="smalltext"><a name="not7" id="not7" href="/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1971/"></a>7. For further   discussion see Section 4 below, which deals with the less   developed countries.</p>
<p class="smalltext"><a name="not8" id="not8" href="/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1971/"></a>8. Many of the   points touched upon in this section are discussed in greater   detail in Simon Kuznets, <i>Economic Growth of Nations: Total   Output and Production Structure</i>, Harvard University Press,   Cambridge, Mass., 1971, particularly in Chapter II (pp. 75-98),   which deals with the non-conventional costs of economic growth,   and Chapter VII (pp. 314-54), which deals with various   interrelations between aggregate change and structural shifts in   economic and other aspects of social structure.</p>
<p class="smalltext"><a name="not9" id="not9" href="/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1971/"></a>9. The   underlying data are from Everett E. Hagen and Oli Hawrylyshyn,   &#8220;Analysis of World Income and Growth, 1955-1965&#8221;, <i>Economic   Development and Cultural Change</i>, vol. 18, no. 1, Part II,   October 1969. These are primarily from United Nations   publications, supplemented by some auxiliary sources (mostly for   the Communist countries), and use conventional conversion rates   to U.S. dollars in 1965. The estimates for the Communist   countries have been adjusted to conform to the international GDP   concept. The developed countries include most countries with per   capita GDP of $1000 or more and Japan, but exclude those small   countries with a high GDP per capita that is due to exceptional   natural endowments (e.g. Netherlands Antilles, Puerto Rico,   Kuwait, and Qatar).</p>
