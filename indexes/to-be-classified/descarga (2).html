<p class="smalltext">Lecture to the memory of Alfred Nobel,   December 9, 1991</p>
<h2>The Institutional Structure of Production</h2>
<p>In my long life I have known some great   economists but I have never counted myself among their number nor   walked in their company. I have made no innovations in high   theory. My contribution to economics has been to urge the   inclusion in our analysis of features of the economic system so   obvious that, like the postman in G.K. Chesterton&#8217;s Father Brown   tale, <i>The Invisible Man</i>, they have tended to be   overlooked. Nonetheless, once included in the analysis, they   will, as I believe, bring about a complete change in the   structure of economic theory, at least in what is called price   theory or microeconomics. What I have done is to show the   importance for the working of the economic system of what may be   termed the institutional structure of production. In this lecture   I shall explain why, in my view, these features of the economic   system were ignored and why their recognition will lead to a   change in the way we analyse the working of the economic system   and in the way we think about economic policy, changes which are   already beginning to occur. I will also speak about the empirical   work that needs to be done if this transformation in our approach   is to increase our understanding. In speaking about this   transformation, I do not wish to suggest that it is the result of   my work alone. <a href="/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2009/">Oliver Williamson</a>, Harold Demsetz, Steven Cheung,   among others, have made outstanding contributions to the subject   and without their work and that of many others, I doubt whether   the significance of my writings would have been recognized. While   it has been a great advantage of the creation of the Prize in   Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel that, by drawing   attention to the significance of particular fields of economics,   it encourages further research in them, the highlighting of the   work of a few scholars, or, in my case, one scholar, tends to   obscure the importance of the contributions of other able   scholars whose researches have been crucial to the development of   the field.</p>
<p>I will be speaking of that part of   economics which has come to be called industrial organization,   but to understand its present state it is necessary to say   something about the development of economics in general. During   the two centuries since the publication of <i>The Wealth of   Nations</i> the main activity of economists, it seems to me, has   been to fill the gaps in Adam Smith&#8217;s system, to correct his   errors and to make his analysis vastly more exact. A principal   theme of <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> was that government   regulation or centralised planning were not necessary to make an   economic system function in an orderly way. The economy could be   co-ordinated by a system of prices (the &#8220;invisible hand&#8221;) and,   furthermore, with beneficial results. A major task of economists   since the publication of <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, as Harold   Demsetz has explained<a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>, has been   to formalize this proposition of Adam Smith. The given factors   are technology and the tastes of consumers, and individuals, who   follow their own interest, are governed in their choices by a   system of prices. Economists have uncovered the conditions   necessary if Adam Smith&#8217;s results are to be achieved and where,   in the real world, such conditions do not appear to be found,   they have proposed changes which are designed to bring them   about. It is what one finds in the textbooks. Harold Demsetz has   said rightly that what this theory analyses is a system of   extreme decentralization. It has been a great intellectual   achievement and it throws light on many aspects of the economic   system. But it has not been by any means all gain. The   concentration on the determination of prices has led to a   narrowing of focus which has had as a result the neglect of other   aspects of the economic system. Sometimes, indeed, it seems as   though economists conceive of their subject as being concerned   only with the pricing system and that anything outside this is   considered as no part of their business. Thus, my old chief and   wonderful human being, Lionel Robbins, wrote, in <i>The Nature   and Significance of Economic Science</i>, about the &#8220;glaring   deficiencies&#8221; of the old treatment of the theory of production   with its discussion of peasant proprietorships and industrial   forms: &#8220;It suggests that from the point of view of the economist   &#8216;organisation&#8217; is a matter of internal industrial (or   agricultural) arrangement &#8211; if not internal to the firm, at any   rate internal to &#8216;the&#8217; industry. At the same time it tends to   leave out completely the governing factor of all productive   organisation &#8211; the relationship of prices and cost&#8230;&#8221;<a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a>. What this comes down to is that, in   Robbins&#8217; view, an economist does not interest himself in the   internal arrangements within organisations but only in what   happens on the market, the purchase of factors of production and   the sale of the goods that these factors produce. What happens in   between the purchase of the factors of production and the sale of   the goods that are produced by these factors is largely ignored.   I do not know how far economists today share Robbins&#8217; attitude   but it is undeniable that microeconomics is largely a study of   the determination of prices and output, indeed this part of   economics is often called price theory.</p>
<p>This neglect of other aspects of the system   has been made easier by another feature of modern economic theory   &#8211; the growing abstraction of the analysis, which does not seem to   call for a detailed knowledge of the actual economic system or,   at any rate, has managed to proceed without it. Holmstrom and   Tirole, writing on <i>The Theory of the Firm</i> in the recently   published <i>Handbook of Industrial Organization</i>, conclude at   the end of their article of 63 pages that &#8220;the evidence/theory   ratio&#8230; is currently very low in this field&#8221;<a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Peltzman has written a scathing review   of the <i>Handbook</i> in which he points out how much of the   discussion in it is theory without any empirical basis<a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a>. What is studied is a system which lives   in the minds of economists but not on earth. I have called the   result &#8220;blackboard economics&#8221;. The firm and the market appear by   name but they lack any substance. The firm in mainstream economic   theory has often been described as a &#8220;black box&#8221;. And so it is.   This is very extraordinary given that most resources in a modern   economic system are employed within firms, with how these   resources are used dependent on administrative decisions and not   directly on the operation of a market. Consequently, the   efficiency of the economic system depends to a very considerable   extent on how these organisations conduct their affairs,   particularly, of course, the modern corporation. Even more   surprising, given their interest in the pricing system, is the   neglect of the market or more specifically the institutional   arrangements which govern the process of exchange. As these   institutional arrangements determine to a large extent what is   produced, what we have is a very incomplete theory. All this is   beginning to change and in this process I am glad to have played   my part. The value of including such institutional factors in the   corpus of mainstream economics is made clear by recent events in   Eastern Europe. These ex-communist countries are advised to move   to a market economy, and their leaders wish to do so, but without   the appropriate institutions no market economy of any   significance is possible. If we knew more about our own economy   we would be in a better position to advise them.</p>
<p>What I endeavoured to do in the two   articles cited by the <a href="http://www.kva.se/en/" target="_blank">Royal   Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> was to attempt to fill these gaps   or more exactly to indicate the direction in which we should move   if they are ultimately to be filled. Let me start with <i>The   Nature of the Firm</i>. I went as a student to the London School of   Economics in 1929 to study for a Bachelor of Commerce degree,   specialising in the Industry group, supposedly designed for   people who wished to become works managers, a choice of   occupation for which I was singularly ill-suited. However, in   1931, I had a great stroke of luck. Arnold Plant was appointed   Professor of Commerce in 1930. He was a wonderful teacher. I   began to attend his seminar in 1931, some five months before I   took the final examinations. It was a revelation. He quoted Sir   Arthur Salter: &#8220;The normal economic system works itself&#8217;. And he   explained how a competitive economic system coordinated by prices   would lead to the production of goods and services which   consumers valued most highly. Before being exposed to Plant&#8217;s   teaching, my notions on how the economy worked were extremely   woolly. After Plant&#8217;s seminar I had a coherent view of the   economic system. He introduced me to Adam Smith&#8217;s &#8220;invisible   hand&#8221;. As I had taken the first year of University work while   still at High School, I managed to complete the requirements for   a degree in two years. However, university regulations required   three years of residence before a degree could be granted. I had   therefore a year to spare. I then had another stroke of luck. I   was awarded a Cassel travelling scholarship by the University of London.   I decided to spend the year in the United States, this being   treated as a year&#8217;s residence at the London School of Economics,   the regulations being somewhat loosely interpreted.</p>
<p>I decided to study vertical and lateral   integration of industry in the United States. Plant had described   in his lectures the different ways in which various industries   were organised, but we seemed to lack any theory which would   explain these differences. I set out to find it. There was also   another puzzle which, in my mind, needed to be solved and which   seemed to be related to my main project. The view of the pricing   system as a co-ordinating mechanism was clearly right but there   were aspects of the argument which troubled me. Plant was opposed   to all schemes, then very fashionable during the Great   Depression, for the co-ordination of industrial production by   some form of planning. Competition, according to Plant, acting   through a system of prices, would do all the co-ordination   necessary. And yet we had a factor of production, management,   whose function was to co-ordinate. Why was it needed if the   pricing system provided all the co-ordination necessary? The same   problem presented itself to me at that time in another guise. The   Russian Revolution had taken place only fourteen years earlier.   We knew then very little about how planning would actually be   carried out in a communist system. Lenin had said that the   economic system in Russia would be run as one big factory.   However, many economists in the West maintained that this was an   impossibility. And yet there were factories in the West and some   of them were extremely large. How did one reconcile the views   expressed by economists on the role of the pricing system and the   impossibility of successful central economic planning with the   existence of management and of these apparently planned   societies, firms, operating within our own economy?<a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>I found the answer by the summer of 1932.   It was to realise that there were costs of using the pricing   mechanism. What the prices are has to be discovered. There are   negotiations to be undertaken, contracts have to be drawn up,   inspections have to be made, arrangements have to be made to   settle disputes, and so on. These costs have come to be known as   transaction costs. Their existence implies that methods of   co-ordination, alternative to the market, which are themselves   costly and in various ways imperfect, may nonetheless be   preferable to relying on the pricing mechanism, the only method   of co-ordination normally analysed by economists. It was   avoidance of the costs of carrying out transactions through the   market that could explain the existence of the firm in which the   allocation of factors came about as a result of administrative   decisions (and I thought it did). In my 1937 article, I argued   that in a competitive system there would be an optimum of   planning since a firm, that little planned society, could only   continue to exist if it performed its co-ordination function at a   lower cost than would be incurred if it were achieved by means of   market transactions and also at a lower cost than this same   function could be performed by another firm. To have an efficient   economic system it is necessary not only to have markets but also   areas of planning within organizations of the appropriate size.   What this mix should be we find as a result of competition. This   is what I said in my article of 1937. However, as we know from a   letter I wrote in 1932, which has been preserved, all the   essentials of this argument had been presented in a lecture I   gave in Dundee at the beginning of October, 1932<a href="#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>. I was then twenty-one years of age and   the sun never ceased to shine. I could never have imagined that   these ideas would become some 60 years later a major   justification for the award of a Nobel Prize. And it is a strange   experience to be praised in my eighties for work I did in my   twenties.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the recognition by   economists of the importance of the role of the firm in the   functioning of the economy will prompt them to investigate its   activities more closely. The work of Oliver Williamson and others   has led to a greater understanding of the factors which govern   what a firm does and how it does it. And we can also hope to   learn much more in future from the studies of the activities of   firms which have recently been initiated by the Center for   Economic Studies of the Bureau of the Census of the United   States. But it would be wrong to think that the most important   consequence for economics of the publication of <i>The Nature of   the Firm</i> has been to direct attention to the importance of   the firm in our modern economy, a result which, in my view, would   have come about in any case. What I think will be considered in   future to have been the important contribution of this article is   the explicit introduction of transaction costs into economic   analysis. I argued in <i>The Nature of the Firm</i> that the   existence of transaction costs leads to the emergence of the   firm. But the effects are pervasive in the economy. Businessmen   in deciding on their ways of doing business and on what to   produce have to take into account transaction costs. If the costs   of making an exchange are greater than the gains which that   exchange would bring, that exchange would not take place and the   greater production that would flow from specialisation would not   be realised. In this way, transaction costs affect not only   contractual arrangements but also what goods and services are   produced. Not to include transaction costs in the theory leaves   many aspects of the working of the economic system unexplained,   including the emergence of the firm, but much else besides. In   fact, a large part of what we think of as economic activity is   designed to accomplish what high transaction costs would   otherwise prevent or to reduce transaction costs so that   individuals can freely negotiate and we can take advantage of   that diffused knowledge of which <a href="/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1974/index.html">Hayek</a> has told us.</p>
<p>I know of only one part of economics in   which transaction costs have been used to explain a major feature   of the economic system and that relates to the evolution and use   of money. Adam Smith pointed out the hindrances to commerce that   would arise in an economic system in which there was a division   of labour but in which all exchange had to take the form of   barter. No-one would be able to buy anything unless he possessed   something that the producer wanted. This difficulty, he   explained, could be overcome by the use of money. A person   wishing to buy something in a barter system has to find someone   who has this product for sale but who also wants some of the   goods possessed by the potential buyer. Similarly, a person   wishing to sell something has to find someone who both wants what   he has to offer and also possesses something that the potential   seller wants. Exchange in a barter system requires what Jevons   called &#8220;this double coincidence&#8221;. Clearly the search for partners   in exchange with suitable qualifications is likely to be very   costly and will prevent many potentially beneficial exchanges   from taking place. The benefit brought about by the use of money   consists of a reduction in transaction costs. The use of money   also reduces transaction costs by facilitating the drawing up of   contracts as well as by reducing the quantity of goods that need   to be held for purposes of exchange. However, the nature of the   benefits secured by the use of money seems to have faded into the   background so far as economists are concerned and it does not   seem to have been noticed that there are other features of the   economic system which exist because of the need to mitigate   transaction costs.</p>
<p>I now turn to that other article cited by   the Swedish Academy, <i>The Problem of Social Cost</i>, published   some 30 years ago. I will not say much here about its influence   on legal scholarship which has been immense but will mainly   consider its influence on economics, which has not been immense,   although I believe that in time it will be. It is my view that   the approach used in that article will ultimately transform the   structure of microeconomics &#8211; and I will explain why. I should   add that in writing this article I had no such general aim in   mind. I thought that I was exposing the weaknesses of Pigou&#8217;s   analysis of the divergence between private and social products,   an analysis generally accepted by economists, and that was all.   It was only later, and in part as a result of conversations with   Steven Cheung in the 1960s that I came to see the general   significance for economic theory of what I had written in that   article and also to see more clearly what questions needed to be   further investigated.</p>
<p>Pigou&#8217;s conclusion and that of most   economists using standard economic theory was, and perhaps still   is, that some kind of government action (usually the imposition   of taxes) was required to restrain those whose actions had   harmful effects on others, often termed negative externalities.   What I showed in that article, as I thought, was that in a regime   of zero transaction costs, an assumption of standard economic   theory, negotiations between the parties would lead to those   arrangements being made which would maximise wealth and this   irrespective of the initial assignment of rights. This is the   infamous <i>Coase Theorem</i>, named and formulated by <a href="/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1982/index.html">Stigler</a>, although it   is based on work of mine. Stigler argues that the Coase Theorem   follows from the standard assumptions of economic theory. Its   logic cannot be questioned, only its domain<a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a>. I do not disagree with Stigler.   However, I tend to regard the Coase Theorem as a stepping stone   on the way to an analysis of an economy with positive transaction   costs. The significance to me of the Coase Theorem is that it   undermines the Pigovian system. Since standard economic theory   assumes transaction costs to be zero, the Coase Theorem   demonstrates that the Pigovian solutions are unnecessary in these   circumstances. Of course, it does not imply, when transaction   costs are positive, that government actions (such as government   operation, regulation or taxation, including subsidies) could not   produce a better result than relying on negotiations between   individuals in the market. Whether this would be so could be   discovered not by studying imaginary governments but what real   governments actually do. My conclusion; let us study the world of   positive transaction costs.</p>
<p>If we move from a regime of zero   transaction costs to one of positive transaction costs, what   becomes immediately clear is the crucial importance of the legal   system in this new world. I explained in <i>The Problem of Social   Cost</i> that what are traded on the market are not, as is often   supposed by economists, physical entities but the rights to   perform certain actions and the rights which individuals possess   are established by the legal system. While we can imagine in the   hypothetical world of zero transaction costs that the parties to   an exchange would negotiate to change any provision of the law   which prevents them from taking whatever steps are required to   increase the value of production, in the real world of positive   transaction costs such a procedure would be extremely costly, and   would make unprofitable, even where it was allowed, a great deal   of such contracting around the law. Because of this, the rights   which individuals possess, with their duties and privileges, will   be, to a large extent what the law determines. As a result the   legal system will have a profound effect on the working of the   economic system and may in certain respects be said to control   it. It is obviously desirable that these rights should be   assigned to those who can use them most productively and with   incentives that lead them to do so and that, to discover and   maintain such a distribution of rights, the costs of their   transference should be low, through clarity in the law and by   making the legal requirements for such transfers less onerous.   Since this can come about only if there is an appropriate system   of property rights, and they are enforced, it is easy to   understand why so many academic lawyers (at least in the United   States) have found so attractive the task of uncovering the   character of such a property rights system and why the subject of   &#8220;law and economics&#8221; has flourished in American law schools.   Indeed, work is going forward at such a pace that I do not   consider it over-optimistic to believe that the main outlines of   the subject will be drawn within five or ten years.</p>
<p>Until quite recently most economists seem   to have been unaware of this relationship between the economic   and legal systems except in the most general way. Stock and   produce exchanges are often used by economists as examples of   perfect or near-perfect competition. But these exchanges regulate   in great detail the activities of traders (and this quite apart   from any public regulation there may be). What can be traded,   when it can be traded, the terms of settlement and so on are all   laid down by the authorities of the exchange. There is, in   effect, a private law. Without such rules and regulations, the   speedy conclusion of trades would not be possible. Of course,   when trading takes place outside exchanges (and this is almost   all trading) and where the dealers are scattered in space and   have very divergent interests, as in retailing and wholesaling,   such a private law would be difficult to establish and their   activities will be regulated by the laws of the State. It makes   little sense for economists to discuss the process of exchange   without specifying the institutional setting within which the   trading takes place since this affects the incentives to produce   and the costs of transacting. I think this is now beginning to be   recognized and has been made crystal-clear by what is going on in   Eastern Europe today. The time has surely gone in which   economists could analyze in great detail two individuals   exchanging nuts for berries on the edge of the forest and then   feel that their analysis of the process of exchange was complete,   illuminating though this analysis may be in certain respects. The   process of contracting needs to be studied in a real world   setting. We would then learn of the problems that are encountered   and of how they are overcome and we would certainly become aware   of the richness of the institutional alternatives between which   we have to choose.</p>
<p>Oliver Williamson has ascribed the non-use   or limited use of my thesis in <i>The Nature of the Firm</i> to   the fact that it has not been made &#8220;operational&#8221;, by which he   means that the concept of transaction costs has not been   incorporated into a general theory. I think this is correct.   There have been two reasons for this. First, incorporating   transaction costs into standard economic theory which has been   based on the assumption that they are zero, would be very   difficult and economists who, like most scientists, as Thomas   Kuhn has told us, are extremely conservative in their methods,   have not been inclined to attempt it. Second, Williamson has also   pointed out that although I was correct in making the choice   between organization within the firm or through the market the   center piece of my analysis, I did not indicate what the factors   were that determined the outcome of this choice and thus made it   difficult for others to build on what is often described as a   &#8220;fundamental insight&#8221;. This also is true. But the   interrelationships which govern the mix of market and hierarchy,   to use Williamson&#8217;s terms, are extremely complex and in our   present state of ignorance it will not be easy to discover what   these factors are. What we need is more empirical work. In a   paper written for a conference of the National Bureau of   Economic Research I explained why I thought this was so. This   is what I said: &#8220;An inspired theoretician might do as well   without such empirical work, but my own feeling is that the   inspiration is most likely to come through the stimulus provided   by the patterns, puzzles and anomalies revealed by the systematic   gathering of data, particularly when the prime need is to break   our existing habits of thought&#8221;*. This statement was made in   1970. I still think that in essentials it is true today. Although   much interesting and important research was done in the seventies   and eighties and we certainly know much more than we did in 1970,   there is little doubt that a great deal more empirical work is   needed. However, I have come to the conclusion that the main   obstacle faced by researchers in industrial organization is the   lack of available data on contracts and the activities of firms.   I have therefore decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>Believing that there is a great deal of   data on contracts and the activities of firms in the United   States available in government departments and agencies in   Washington, D.C., and that this information is largely unknown to   economists, I organized a conference at the University of   Chicago Law School in the Summer of 1990 at which government   officials presented papers in which they described what data was   available and how to get access to it and also reported on some   of the research being carried out within their departments. The   audience consisted of academic economists. It was, as a colleague   remarked, a case of supply meeting demand. The proceedings of   this conference will be published in a special issue of the   <i>Journal of Law and Economics</i>. Another development with   which I am associated is the establishment of the Center for the   Study of Contracts and the Structure of Enterprise at the   Business School of the University of Pittsburgh. This Center will make   large-scale collections of business contracts and will prepare   databases which will be made available to all researchers,   whatever their institution. Nor should we forget the work now   getting started at the Center for Economic Studies of the Bureau   of the Census. This greater availability of data and the   encouragement given to all researchers working on the   institutional structure of production by the award to me of the   Nobel Prize, should result in a reduction in that elegant but   sterile theorizing so commonly found in the economics literature   on industrial organization and should lead to studies which   increase our understanding of how the real economic system   works.</p>
<p>My remarks have sometimes been interpreted   as implying that I am hostile to the mathematization of economic   theory. This is untrue. Indeed, once we begin to uncover the real   factors affecting the performance of the economic system, the   complicated interrelations between them will clearly necessitate   a mathematical treatment, as in the natural sciences, and   economists like myself, who write in prose, will take their bow.   May this period soon come.</p>
<p>I am very much aware that many economists   whom I respect and admire will not agree with the opinions I have   expressed and some may even be offended by them. But a scholar   must be content with the knowledge that what is false in what he   says will soon be exposed and, as for what is true, he can count   on ultimately seeing it accepted, if only he lives long   enough.</p>
